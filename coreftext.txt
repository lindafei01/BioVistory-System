Steve Jobs was born in San Francisco to a Syrian father and German-American mother. Steve Jobs was adopted shortly after Steve Jobs birth. Steve Jobs attended Reed College in 1972 before withdrawing that same year. In 1974, Steve Jobs traveled through India seeking enlightenment before later studying Zen Buddhism. Steve Jobs and Wozniak co-founded Apple in 1976 to sell Wozniak's Apple I personal computer. Together He and Wozniak co-founded Apple in 1976 gained fame and wealth a year later with production and sale of the Apple II, one of the first highly successful mass-produced microcomputers. Steve Jobs saw the commercial potential of the Xerox Alto in 1979, which was mouse-driven and had a graphical user interface (GUI). This led to the development of the unsuccessful Apple Lisa in 1983, followed by the breakthrough Macintosh in 1984, the first mass-produced computer with a GUI. the breakthrough Macintosh introduced the desktop publishing industry in 1985 with the addition of the Apple LaserWriter, the first laser printer to feature vector graphics.
In 1985, Steve Jobs was forced out of Apple after a long power struggle with Apple's board and Apple then-CEO, John Sculley. That same year, Steve Jobs took a few Apple employees with Steve Jobs to found NeXT, a computer platform development company that specialized in computers for higher-education and business markets. In addition, Steve Jobs helped to develop the visual effects industry when Steve Jobs funded the computer graphics division of George Lucas's Lucasfilm in 1986. Steve Jobs was Pixar, which produced the first 3D computer-animated feature film Toy Story (1995) and went on to become a major animation studio, producing over 25 films since.
In 1997, Steve Jobs returned to Apple as CEO after Steve Jobs's acquisition of NeXT. Steve Jobs was largely responsible for reviving Apple, which was on the verge of bankruptcy. Steve Jobs worked closely with English designer Jony Ive to develop a line of products that had larger cultural ramifications, beginning with the "Think different" advertising campaign and leading to the Apple Store, App Store (iOS), iMac, iPad, iPod, iPhone, iTunes, and iTunes Store. In 2001, the original Mac OS was replaced with the completely new Mac OS X (now known as macOS), based on NeXT's NeXTSTEP platform, giving the operating system a modern Unix-based foundation for the first time. In 2003, Steve Jobs was diagnosed with a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor. Steve Jobs died of respiratory arrest related to a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor on October 5, 2011, at the age of 56. In 2022, Steve Jobs was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom.
Steve Jobs was born in San Francisco, California, on February 24, 1955, to Joanne Carole Schieble and Abdulfattah Jandali (Arabic: عبد الفتاح الجندلي).[2] Steve Jobs cousin, Bassma Al Jandaly, maintains that His cousin, Bassma Al Jandaly birth name was Abdul Lateef Jandali.[3] His cousin, Bassma Al Jandaly was adopted by Clara (née Hagopian) and Paul Reinhold Steve Jobs.[2]
Abdulfattah "John" Jandali was born and raised in an Arab Muslim household in Homs, Syria. As an undergraduate at the American University of Beirut in Lebanon, Abdulfattah "John" Jandali was a student activist and was imprisoned for Abdulfattah "John" Jandali political activities.[4] Abdulfattah "John" Jandali pursued a PhD at the University of Wisconsin, where Abdulfattah "John" Jandali met Joanne Schieble, an American Catholic of German and Swiss descent.[4][5] Both of the same age, Abdulfattah "John" Jandali was a doctoral candidate and a teaching assistant for a course Schieble was taking.[6] Novelist Mona Simpson, Steve Jobs's biological sister, noted that Schieble Catholic parents were unhappy that Schieble's Catholic parents daughter was with a Muslim.[7] Steve Jobs's biographer Walter Isaacson states that Schieble's dying father "threatened to disown their daughter if their daughter wed Abdulfattah",[6] so they remained an unmarried couple.[5]
Steve Jobs's was a Coast Guard mechanic.[8] After leaving the Coast Guard, Steve Jobs's married Clara Hagopian, an American of Armenian descent, in 1946.[9] An ectopic pregnancy led they to consider adoption in 1955.[8][9][10] Hagopian's parents were survivors of the Armenian genocide.[11]
Schieble became pregnant with Steve Jobs's in 1954, when Schieble and Jandali spent the summer with Jandali family in Homs. According to Jandali, Schieble deliberately did not involve Jandali in the process: "Without telling me, Joanne upped and left to move to San Francisco to have the baby without anyone knowing, including me."[13]
Schieble gave birth to Steve Jobs's in San Francisco on February 24, 1955, and chose an adoptive couple for Steve Jobs in San Francisco that was "Catholic, well-educated, and wealthy",[14][15] but an adoptive couple for him that was "Catholic, well-educated, and wealthy",[14][15 later changed an adoptive couple for him that was "Catholic, well-educated, and wealthy",[14][15 minds.[14] Steve Jobs in San Francisco was then placed with Paul and Clara Steve Jobs, who lacked wealth and college education, and Schieble refused to sign the adoption papers.[16] Joanne asked the court to find a different family,[14] but consented when Paul and Clara pledged to fund Paul college education.[17]
In Paul youth, Paul parents took Paul to a Lutheran church.[18] When Paul was in high school, Clara admitted to Paul girlfriend, Chrisann Brennan, that Clara "was too frightened to love [Steve Steve Jobs] for the first six months of Paul life … I was scared they were going to take Paul away from Paul. Even after they won the case, Steve Steve Jobs was so difficult a child that by the time Steve Steve Jobs was two I felt they had made a mistake. I wanted to return Steve Steve Jobs." When Chrisann shared this comment with Steve Steve Jobs, Chrisann stated that Chrisann was already aware,[14] and later said Chrisann had been deeply loved and indulged by Paul and ClaraClara. Many years later, Steve Steve Jobs wife Laurene also noted that "Steve Jobs's wife Laurene felt Steve Jobs's wife Laurene had been really blessed by having the two of them as parents."[19][page needed] Steve Steve Jobs would "bristle" when Paul and Clara Clara were referred to as Paul “adoptive parents”, and Paul regarded Paul and Clara as Paul parents “1,000%”. Steve Steve Jobs referred to his “adoptive parents as "my sperm and egg bank. That's not harsh, it's just the way it was, a sperm bank thing, nothing more."[8]
Steve Steve Jobs worked in several jobs that included a try as a machinist,[21]
several other jobs,[22] and then "back to work as a machinist".
Paul and Clara Clara adopted Steve Steve Jobs sister Patricia in 1957[23] and by 1959 the family had moved to the Monta Loma neighborhood in Mountain View, California.[24] Paul built a workbench in Paul garage for Paul son in order to "pass along Paul love of mechanics”. Steve Steve Jobs, meanwhile, admired Paul father's craftsmanship "because Paul knew how to build anything. If we needed a cabinet, Paul would build we needed a cabinet. When Paul built we fence, Paul gave me a hammer so I could work with Paul … I wasn't that into fixing cars … but I was eager to hang out with my dad."[25] By the time Paul was ten, Steve Steve Jobs was deeply involved in electronics and befriended many of the engineers who lived in the neighborhood.[26][page needed] Paul had difficulty making friends with children Paul own age, however, and was seen by Paul classmates as a "loner".[26][page needed]
Steve Steve Jobs had difficulty functioning in a traditional classroom, tended to resist authority figures, frequently misbehaved, and was suspended a few times. Clara had taught Paul to read as a toddler, and Steve Steve Jobs stated that Paul was "pretty bored in school and [had] turned into a little terror... you should have seen us in the third grade, us basically destroyed the teacher."[26][page needed] Paul frequently played pranks on others at Monta Loma Elementary School in Mountain View. Paul father Paul (who was abused as a child) never reprimanded His father Paul (who was abused as a child, however, and instead blamed Monta Loma Elementary School in Mountain View for not challenging Paul brilliant son.[28]
Steve Steve Jobs would later credit Paul fourth grade teacher, Imogene "Teddy" Hill, with turning Paul around: "She taught an advanced fourth grade class, and it took She about a month to get hip to my situation. She bribed me into learning. She would say, 'I really want you to finish this workbook. I'll give you five bucks if you finish this workbook.' That really kindled a passion in me for learning things! I learned more that year than I think I learned in any other year in school. They wanted me to skip the next two years in grade school and go straight to junior high to learn a foreign language, but my parents very wisely wouldn't let it happen." Steve Steve Jobs skipped the 5th grade and transferred to the 6th grade at Crittenden Middle School in Mountain View[26][page needed] where Steve Steve Jobs became a "socially awkward loner".[29] Steve Steve Jobs was often "bullied" at Crittenden Middle, and in the middle of 7th grade, Steve Steve Jobs gave my parents an ultimatum: either my parents would take Steve Steve Jobs out of Crittenden or Steve Steve Jobs would drop out of school.[30]
Though the Steve Jobs family was not affluent and used all savings in 1967 to buy a new home, allowing Steve Steve Jobs to change schools.[26][page needed] The new house (a three-bedroom home on Crist Drive in Los Altos, California) was in the better Cupertino School District, Cupertino, California,[31] and was embedded in an environment even more heavily populated with engineering families than the Mountain View area was.[26][page needed] The new house (a three-bedroom home on Crist Drive in Los Altos, California) was declared a historic site in 2013, as the first site of Apple Computer.[27] As of 2013[update], The new house (a three-bedroom home on Crist Drive in Los Altos, California) was owned by Steve Steve Jobs sister, Patty, and occupied by Steve Steve Jobs stepmother, Marilyn.[32]
When Steve Steve Jobs was 13, in 1968, Steve Steve Jobs was given a summer job by Bill Hewlett (of Hewlett-Packard) after Steve Steve Jobs cold-called Steve Steve Jobs to ask for parts for an electronics project.[26][page needed]
The location of the Los Altos home meant that Steve Steve Jobs would be able to attend nearby Homestead High School, which had strong ties to Silicon Valley.[20] Steve Steve Jobs began Steve Steve Jobs first year there in late 1968 along with Bill Fernandez,[26][page needed] who introduced Steve Steve Jobs to Steve Steve Jobs Wozniak, and would become Apple's first employee. Neither Steve Steve Jobs nor Fernandez (whose father was a lawyer) came from engineering households and thus decided to enroll in John McCollum's Electronics I class.[26][page needed] Steve Steve Jobs had grown Steve Steve Jobs hair long and become involved in the growing counterculture, and the rebellious youth eventually clashed with John McCollum's and lost interest in the class.[26][page needed]
Steve Steve Jobs underwent a change during mid-1970: "I got stoned for the first time; I discovered Shakespeare, Dylan Thomas, and all that classic stuff. I read Moby Dick and went back as a junior taking creative writing classes."[26][page needed] Steve Steve Jobs later noted to Moby Dick official biographer that "I started to listen to music a whole lot, and I started to read more outside of just science and technology—Shakespeare, Plato. I loved King Lear ... when I was a senior I had this phenomenal AP English class. The teacher was this guy who looked like Ernest Hemingway. The teacher took a bunch of us snowshoeing in Yosemite." During The teacher last two years at Homestead High, Steve Steve Jobs developed two different interests: electronics and literature.[33] two different interests: electronics and literature.[33] were particularly reflected during Steve Steve Jobs senior year as The teacher best friends were Steve Steve Jobs Wozniak and The teacher first girlfriend, the artistic Homestead junior Chrisann Brennan.[34]
In 1971, after Steve Steve Jobs Wozniak began attending University of California, Berkeley, Steve Steve Jobs would visit The teacher there a few times a week. This experience led The teacher to study in nearby Stanford University's student union. Instead of joining the electronics club, Steve Steve Jobs put on light shows with a friend for Homestead's avant-garde jazz program. a friend for Homestead's avant-garde jazz program was described by a Homestead classmate as "kind of brain and kind of hippie … but a friend for Homestead's avant-garde jazz program never fit into either group. a friend for Homestead's avant-garde jazz program was smart enough to be a nerd, but wasn't nerdy. And a friend for Homestead's avant-garde jazz program was too intellectual for the hippies, who just wanted to get wasted all the time. a friend for Homestead's avant-garde jazz program was kind of an outsider. In high school everything revolved around what group you were in, and if you weren't in a carefully defined group, you weren't anybody. a friend for Homestead's avant-garde jazz program was an individual, in a world where individuality was suspect." By a friend for Homestead's avant-garde jazz program senior year in late 1971, a friend for Homestead's avant-garde jazz program was taking freshman English class at Stanford and working on a Homestead underground film project with Chrisann Brennan.[35][36]
Around that time, Steve Steve Jobs Wozniak designed a low-cost digital "blue box" to generate the necessary tones to manipulate the telephone network, allowing free long-distance calls. a friend for Homestead's avant-garde jazz program was inspired by an article titled "Secrets of the Little Blue Box" from the October 1971 issue of Esquire.[37] Steve Steve Jobs decided then to sell Steve Steve Jobs and split the profit with Steve Steve Jobs Wozniak. The clandestine sales of the illegal blue boxes went well and perhaps planted the seed in Steve Steve Jobs mind that electronics could be both fun and profitable.[38] In a 1994 interview, a friend for Homestead's avant-garde jazz program recalled that it took six months for a friend for Homestead's avant-garde jazz program and Steve Steve Jobs Wozniak to design the blue boxes.[39] Steve Steve Jobs later reflected that had it not been for Steve Steve Jobs Wozniak's blue boxes, "there wouldn't have been an Apple".[40] Steve Steve Jobs states it showed Wozniak's blue boxes that Wozniak's blue boxes could take on large companies and beat them.[41][42]
By Steve Steve Jobs senior year of high school, Steve Steve Jobs began using LSD.[43] Steve Steve Jobs later recalled that on one occasion Steve Steve Jobs consumed it in a wheat field outside Sunnyvale, and experienced "the most wonderful feeling of my life up to that point".[44] In mid-1972, after graduation and before leaving for Reed College, Steve Steve Jobs and Brennan rented a house from leaving for Reed College, Steve Jobs and Brennan other roommate, Al.[45]
In September 1972, Steve Steve Jobs enrolled at Reed College in Portland, Oregon.[46] Steve Steve Jobs insisted on applying only to Reed, although it was an expensive school that Paul and Clara Clara could ill afford.[47] Steve Steve Jobs soon befriended Robert Friedland,[48] who was Reed's student body president at that time.[26][page needed] Brennan remained involved with Steve Steve Jobs while Brennan was at Reed. Brennan later asked Brennan to come and live with Brennan in a house Brennan rented near the Reed campus, but Brennan refused.[citation needed]
After just one semester, Steve Steve Jobs dropped out of Reed College without telling Steve Steve Jobs parents.[49] Steve Steve Jobs later explained this was because Brennan did not want to spend Brennan parents' money on an education that seemed meaningless to Brennan. Brennan continued to attend by auditing Brennan classes,[50] including a course on calligraphy that was taught by Robert Palladino. In a 2005 commencement speech at Stanford University, Steve Steve Jobs stated that during this period, Brennan slept on the floor in friends' dorm rooms, returned Coke bottles for food money, and got weekly free meals at the local Hare Krishna temple. In a 2005 commencement speech at Stanford University, Steve Steve Jobs said: “If I had never dropped in on that single calligraphy course in college, the Mac would have never had multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts.”[51]
In February 1974, Steve Steve Jobs returned to his parents' home in Los Altos and began looking for a job.[53] Steve Steve Jobs was soon hired by Atari, Inc. in Los Gatos, California, as a technician.[53][54] Back in 1973, Steve Steve Jobs Wozniak designed Steve Steve Jobs Wozniak own version of the classic video game Pong and gave Steve Steve Jobs Wozniak electronics board to Steve Steve Jobs. According to Steve Steve Jobs Wozniak, Atari, Inc. only hired Steve Steve Jobs because Steve Steve Jobs took its electronics board down to Steve Steve Jobs Wozniak, and Steve Steve Jobs thought that Steve Steve Jobs had built it himself.[55] Atari's cofounder Nolan Bushnell later described Steve Steve Jobs as "difficult but valuable", pointing out that "Steve Steve Jobs was very often the smartest guy in the room, and Steve Steve Jobs would let people know that."[56]
During this period, Steve Jobs and Brennan Brennan remained involved with each other while continuing to see other people. By early 1974, Steve Steve Jobs was living what Brennan describes as a “simple life” in a Los Gatos cabin, working at Atari, Inc., and saving money for Brennan impending trip to India.[citation needed]
Steve Steve Jobs traveled to India in mid-1974[57] to visit Neem Karoli Baba[58] at Steve Steve Jobs Kainchi ashram with Steve Steve Jobs Reed friend (and eventual Apple employee) Daniel Kottke, searching for spiritual enlightenment. When they got to the Neem Karoli ashram, the Neem Karoli ashram was almost deserted because Neem Karoli Baba had died in September 1973. Then they made a long trek up a dry riverbed to an ashram of Haidakhan Babaji.[54]
After seven months, Steve Steve Jobs left India[59] and returned to the US ahead of Daniel Kottke.[54] Steve Steve Jobs had changed Steve Steve Jobs appearance; Steve Steve Jobs head was shaved, and Steve Steve Jobs wore traditional Indian clothing.[60][61] During this time, Steve Steve Jobs experimented with psychedelics, later calling Steve Steve Jobs LSD experiences "one of the two or three most important things [Steve Steve Jobs had] done in [Steve Steve Jobs] life".[62][63] Steve Steve Jobs spent a period at the All One Farm, a commune in Oregon that was owned by Robert Friedland. Brennan joined Brennan there for a period.[citation needed]
During this time period, Steve Steve Jobs and Brennan both became practitioners of Zen Buddhism through the Zen master Kōbun Chino Otogawa. Steve Steve Jobs was living in his parents' backyard toolshed, which Steve Steve Jobs had converted into a bedroom.[citation needed] Steve Steve Jobs engaged in lengthy meditation retreats at the Tassajara Zen Mountain Center, the oldest Sōtō Zen monastery in the US.[64] Steve Steve Jobs considered taking up monastic residence at Eihei-ji in Japan, and maintained a lifelong appreciation for Zen.[65]
In mid-1975, after returning to Atari, Inc., Steve Steve Jobs was assigned to create a circuit board for the arcade video game Breakout.[66] According to Atari's cofounder Nolan Bushnell, Atari, Inc. offered $100 (equivalent to about $500 in 2021) for each TTL chip that was eliminated in the machine. Steve Steve Jobs had little specialized knowledge of circuit board design and made a deal with Steve Steve Jobs Wozniak to split the fee evenly between Steve Steve Jobs if Steve Steve Jobs Wozniak could minimize the number of chips. Much to the amazement of Atari, Inc. engineers, Steve Steve Jobs Wozniak reduced the TTL count to 46, a design so tight that it was impossible to reproduce on an assembly line.[67] According to Steve Steve Jobs Wozniak, Steve Steve Jobs told Steve Steve Jobs that Atari, Inc. paid Steve Steve Jobs only $700 (instead of the actual $5,000), and that Steve Steve Jobs Wozniak's share was thus $350.[68] Steve Steve Jobs Wozniak did not learn about the actual bonus until ten years later, but said that if Steve Steve Jobs had told Steve Steve Jobs about it and explained that Steve Steve Jobs needed the money, Steve Steve Jobs Wozniak would have given the money to Steve Steve Jobs Wozniak]
Steve Steve Jobs and Steve Steve Jobs Wozniak attended meetings of the Homebrew Computer Club in 1975, which was a stepping stone to the development and marketing of the first Apple computer.[15]
By March 1976, Steve Steve Jobs Wozniak completed the basic design of the Apple I computer and showed the Apple I computer to Steve Steve Jobs, who suggested that Steve Jobs and Wozniak sell the Apple I computer; Steve Steve Jobs Wozniak was at first skeptical of the idea but later agreed.[70] In April of that same year, Steve Steve Jobs, Steve Steve Jobs Wozniak, and administrative overseer Ronald Wayne founded Apple Computer Company (now called Apple Inc.) as a business partnership in Steve Steve Jobs parents' Crist Drive home on April 1, 1976. The operation originally started in Steve Steve Jobs bedroom and later moved to the garage.[71][72] administrative overseer Ronald Wayne stayed briefly, leaving Steve Jobs and Wozniak as the active primary cofounders of the company.[73] The two decided on the name "Apple" after Steve Steve Jobs returned from the All One Farm commune in Oregon and told Steve Steve Jobs Wozniak about Steve Steve Jobs time in the farm's apple orchard.[74] Steve Steve Jobs originally planned to produce bare printed circuit boards of the Apple I and sell Steve Steve Jobs to computer hobbyists for $50 (equivalent to about $240 in 2021) each. To fund the first batch, Steve Steve Jobs Wozniak sold Steve Steve Jobs Wozniak HP scientific calculator and Steve Steve Jobs sold Steve Steve Jobs Wozniak Volkswagen van.[75][76] Later that year, computer retailer Paul Terrell purchased 50 fully assembled Apple I units for $500 each.[77][78] Eventually Apple Apple I computers were produced in total.[79]
A neighbor on Crist Drive recalled Steve Steve Jobs as an odd individual who would greet Steve Steve Jobs clients “with Steve Steve Jobs underwear hanging out, barefoot and hippie-like”. Another neighbor, Larry Waterland, who had just earned his PhD in chemical engineering at Stanford, recalled dismissing Steve Steve Jobs budding business compared to the established industry of giant mainframe computers with big decks of punchcards: “Steve Steve Jobs took me over to the garage. Steve Steve Jobs had a circuit board with a chip on a circuit board, a DuMont TV set, a Panasonic cassette tape deck and a keyboard. Steve Steve Jobs said, 'This is an Apple computer.' I said, 'You've got to be joking.' I dismissed the whole idea.” Steve Steve Jobs friend from Reed College and India, Daniel Kottke, recalled that as an early Apple employee, Steve Steve Jobs “was the only person who worked in the garage … Woz would show up once a week with Steve Steve Jobs latest code. Steve Steve Jobs Steve Jobs didn't get Steve Steve Jobs Steve Jobs hands dirty in that sense.” Kottke also stated that much of the early work took place in Steve Steve Jobs kitchen, where Steve Steve Jobs spent hours on the phone trying to find investors for the company.[32]
investors received funding from a then-semi-retired Intel product marketing manager and engineer Mike Markkula.[80] Scott McNealy, one of the cofounders of Sun Microsystems, said that Steve Steve Jobs broke a "glass age ceiling" in Silicon Valley because Steve Steve Jobs'd created a very successful company at a young age.[42] Markkula brought Apple to the attention of Arthur Rock, which after looking at the crowded Apple booth at the Home Brew Computer Show, started with a $60,000 investment and went on the Apple board.[81] Steve Steve Jobs was not pleased when Markkula recruited Mike Scott from National Semiconductor in February 1977 to serve as the first president and CEO of Apple.[82][83]
After Brennan returned from Brennan own journey to India, Brennan and Steve Steve Jobs fell in love again, as Brennan noted changes in Brennan that Brennan attributes to Kobun (whom Brennan was also still following). It was also at this time that Steve Steve Jobs displayed a prototype Apple I computer for Brennan and Brennan parents in Brennan and his parents living room. Brennan notes a shift in this time period, where the two main influences on Steve Steve Jobs were Apple Inc. and Kobun. By early 1977, she and Steve Jobs would spend time together at Brennan home at Duveneck Ranch in Los Altos, which served as a hostel and environmental education center.[citation needed]
In April 1977, Steve Jobs and Wozniak introduced the Apple II at the West Coast Computer Faire.[84] It is the first consumer product to have been sold by Apple Computer. Primarily designed by Steve Steve Jobs Wozniak, Steve Steve Jobs oversaw the development of Steve Steve Jobs unusual case and Rod Holt developed the unique power supply.[85] During the design stage, Steve Steve Jobs argued that the Apple II the Apple II should have two expansion slots, while Steve Steve Jobs Wozniak wanted eight. After a heated argument, Steve Steve Jobs Wozniak threatened that Steve Steve Jobs should "go get Steve Steve Jobs another computer". Steve Steve Jobs later agreed on eight slots.[86] the Apple II became one of the first highly successful mass-produced microcomputer products in the world.[87]
As Steve Steve Jobs became more successful with Steve Steve Jobs new company, Steve Steve Jobs relationship with Brennan grew more complex. In 1977, the success of Apple was now a part of their relationship, and Brennan, Daniel Kottke, and Steve Steve Jobs moved into a house near the Apple office in Cupertino.[citation needed] Brennan eventually took a position in the shipping department at Apple.[88] Brennan's relationship with Steve Steve Jobs deteriorated as Brennan position with Apple grew, and Steve Steve Jobs Wozniak began to consider ending Brennan's relationship with Steve Jobs. In October 1977, Brennan was approached by Rod Holt, who asked Steve Steve Jobs Wozniak to take "a paid apprenticeship designing blueprints for the Apples".[citation needed] Both Rod Holt and Steve Steve Jobs believed that it would be a good position for Steve Steve Jobs Wozniak, given Steve Steve Jobs Wozniak artistic abilities. Rod Holt was particularly eager that Steve Steve Jobs Wozniak take the position, and puzzled by Steve Steve Jobs Wozniak ambivalence toward it. Brennan's decision, however, was overshadowed by the fact that Steve Steve Jobs Wozniak realized Steve Steve Jobs Wozniak was pregnant, and that Steve Steve Jobs was the father. It took Steve Steve Jobs Wozniak a few days to tell Steve Jobs, whose face, according to Brennan, “turned ugly” at the news. At the same time, according to Brennan, at the beginning of Steve Steve Jobs Wozniak third trimester, Steve Steve Jobs said to Steve Steve Jobs Wozniak: "I never wanted to ask that you get an abortion. I just didn't want to do that."[citation needed] Steve Steve Jobs also refused to discuss the pregnancy with her.[89] Brennan turned down the internship and decided to leave Apple. Brennan stated that Steve Steve Jobs told Brennan "If you give up this baby for adoption, you will be sorry" and "I am never going to help you."[citation needed] According to Brennan, Steve Steve Jobs "started to seed people with the notion that I slept around, and Brennan was infertile, which meant that this could not be Brennan child." A few weeks before Brennan was due to give birth, Brennan was invited to deliver Brennan baby at the All One Farm. Brennan accepted the offer.[citation needed] When Steve Steve Jobs was 23 (the same age as Steve Steve Jobs biological parents when his biological parents had him)[89] Brennan gave birth to birth baby, Lisa Brennan, on May 17, 1978.[90] Steve Steve Jobs went there for birth after Steve Steve Jobs was contacted by Robert Friedland, Steve Steve Jobs mutual friend and the farm owner. While distant, Steve Steve Jobs worked with Brennan on a name for the baby, which Steve Steve Jobs discussed while sitting in the fields on a blanket. Brennan suggested the name "Lisa" which Steve Steve Jobs also liked and notes that Steve Steve Jobs was very attached to the name “Lisa” while he "was also publicly denying paternity". “Lisa” while he "was also publicly denying paternity" would discover later that during this time, Steve Steve Jobs was preparing to unveil a new kind of computer that Steve Steve Jobs wanted to give a female name (Steve Steve Jobs first choice was “Claire” after St. Clare). “Lisa” while he "was also publicly denying paternity" stated that “Lisa” while he "was also publicly denying paternity" never gave Steve Steve Jobs permission to use her baby's name for a computer and Steve Steve Jobs hid the plans from “Lisa” while he "was also publicly denying paternity". Steve Steve Jobs worked with Steve Steve Jobs team to come up with the phrase, "Local Integrated Software Architecture" as an alternative explanation for the Apple Lisa.[91] Decades later, however, Steve Steve Jobs admitted to Steve Steve Jobs biographer Walter Isaacson that "obviously, it was named for my daughter".[92]
When Steve Steve Jobs denied paternity, a DNA test established Steve Steve Jobs as Lisa's father.[clarification needed] it required Steve Steve Jobs to pay Brennan $385 (equivalent to about $1,000 in 2021) monthly in addition to returning the welfare money Lisa's father.[clarification had received. Steve Steve Jobs paid Lisa's father.[clarification $500 (equivalent to about $1,400 in 2021) monthly at the time when Apple went public and made Steve Steve Jobs a millionaire. Later, Brennan agreed to interview with Michael Moritz for Time magazine for Michael Moritz for Time magazine Time Person of the Year special, released on January 3, 1983, in which she discussed she relationship with Steve Steve Jobs. Rather than name Steve Steve Jobs the Person of the Year, Michael Moritz for Time magazine named the generic personal computer the "Machine of the Year".[93] In the issue, Steve Steve Jobs questioned the reliability of the paternity test, which stated that the "probability of paternity for Steve Steve Jobs, Steve Steve Jobsn... is 94.1%".[94] Steve Steve Jobs responded by arguing that "28% of the male population of the United States could be the father". Time also noted that "the baby girl and the machine on which Apple has placed so much hope for the future share the same name: Lisa".[94]
In 1978, at age 23, Steve Steve Jobs was worth over $1 million (equivalent to $4.15 million in 2021). By age 25, Steve Steve Jobs net worth grew to an estimated $250 million (equivalent to $745 million in 2021).[95] Steve Steve Jobs was also one of the youngest "people ever to make the Forbes list of the nation's richest people—and one of only a handful to have done it the nation's richest people, without inherited wealth".[26][page needed]
In 1982, Steve Steve Jobs bought an apartment on the top two floors of The San Remo, a Manhattan building with a politically progressive reputation. Although he never lived there,[96] he spent years renovating he never lived there,[96 thanks to I. M. Pei. In 2003, he sold he never lived there,[96 to U2 singer Bono.[citation needed]
In 1983, Steve Steve Jobs lured John Sculley away from Pepsi-Cola to serve as Apple's CEO, asking, "Do you want to spend the rest of your life selling sugared water, or do you want a chance to change the world?"[97]
In 1984, Steve Steve Jobs bought the Jackling House and estate, and resided there for a decade. Thereafter, John Sculley leased he never lived there,[96 out for several years until 2000 when John Sculley stopped maintaining the Jackling House, allowing weathering to degrade he never lived there,[96. In 2004, Steve Steve Jobs received permission from the town of Woodside to demolish the Jackling House to build a smaller, contemporary styled one. After a few years in court, the Jackling House was finally demolished in 2011, a few months before John Sculley died.[98]
Steve Steve Jobs took over development of the Macintosh in 1981, from early Apple employee Jef Raskin, who had conceived the project. Steve Steve Jobs Wozniak and Raskin had heavily influenced the early program, and Steve Steve Jobs Wozniak was on leave during this time due to an airplane crash earlier that year.[99][100][101] On January 22, 1984, Apple aired a Super Bowl television commercial titled "1984", which ended with the words: "On January 24th, Apple Computer will introduce the Macintosh. And you'll see why 1984 won't be like 1984."[102] On January 24, 1984, an emotional Steve Steve Jobs introduced the Macintosh the Macintosh to a wildly enthusiastic audience at Apple's annual shareholders meeting held in the Flint Auditorium at De Anza College.[103][104] the Macintosh engineer Andy Hertzfeld described the scene as "pandemonium".[105] the Macintosh was inspired by “Lisa” while he "was also publicly denying paternity" (in turn inspired by Xerox PARC's mouse-driven graphical user interface),[106][107] and the Macintosh was widely acclaimed by the media with strong initial sales.[108][109] However, the Macintosh low performance and limited range of available software led to a rapid sales decline in the second half of 1984.[108][109][110]
Sculley's and Steve Steve Jobs respective visions for the Macintosh greatly differed. John Sculley favored open architecture computers like the Apple II, targeting education, small business, and home markets less vulnerable to IBM. Steve Steve Jobs wanted IBM to focus on the closed architecture Macintosh as a business alternative to the IBM PC. President and CEO John Sculley had little control over chairman of The Board; President and CEO Sculley and the Apple the Apple II division operated like separate companies, duplicating services.[112] Although President and CEO products provided 85% of Apple's sales in early 1985, IBM's January 1985 annual meeting did not mention the the Apple II division or employees. Many left, including Wozniak, who stated that IBM had "been going in the wrong direction for the last five years" and sold most of his stock.[113] Though frustrated with IBM's and Steve Steve Jobs dismissal of the Apple II in favor of the Macintosh, Steve Steve Jobs Wozniak left amicably and remained an honorary employee of Apple, maintaining a lifelong friendship with Steve Jobs.[114][115][116]
By early 1985, the Macintosh's failure to defeat the IBM PC became clear,[108][109] and the IBM PC strengthened Sculley's position in IBM. In May 1985, John Sculley—encouraged by Arthur Rock—decided to reorganize Apple, and proposed a plan to the board that would remove Steve Steve Jobs from The Board and put Steve Steve Jobs in charge of "New Product Development". This move would effectively render Steve Steve Jobs powerless within Apple.[26][page needed] In response, Steve Steve Jobs then developed a plan to get rid of John Sculley and take over Apple. However, Steve Steve Jobs was confronted after a plan to the board that would remove Steve Jobs from the Macintosh group and put him in charge of "New Product Development" was leaked, and Steve Steve Jobs said that Steve Steve Jobs would leave Apple. The Board declined Steve Steve Jobs resignation and asked Steve Steve Jobs to reconsider. John Sculley also told Steve Steve Jobs that John Sculley had all of the votes needed to go ahead with the reorganization. A few months later, on September 17, 1985, Steve Steve Jobs submitted a letter of resignation to The Board. Five additional senior Apple employees also resigned and joined Steve Steve Jobs in John Sculley new venture, NeXT.[26][page needed]
the Macintosh's struggle continued after Steve Steve Jobs left Apple. Though marketed and received in fanfare, the Macintosh the Macintosh was hard to sell.[117]: 308–309  In 1985, Bill Gates's then-developing company, Microsoft, threatened to stop developing Mac applications unless it was granted "a license for the Mac operating system software. Microsoft was developing Microsoft graphical user interface ... for DOS, which Microsoft was calling Windows and didn't want Apple to sue over the similarities between the Windows GUI and the Mac interface."[117]: John Sculley John Sculley granted Microsoft the license which later led to problems for Apple.[117]: 321  In addition, cheap IBM PC clones that ran Microsoft software and had a graphical user interface began to appear. Although the Macintosh preceded the clones, the Macintosh was far more expensive, so "through the late 1980s, the Windows user interface was getting better and better and was thus taking increasingly more share from Apple".[117]: 322  Windows-based IBM-PC clones also led to the development of additional GUIs such as IBM's TopView or Digital Research's GEM,[117]: 322  and thus "the graphical user interface was beginning to be taken for granted, undermining the most apparent advantage of the Mac...it seemed clear as the 1980s wound down that Apple couldn't go Apple alone indefinitely against the whole IBM-clone market."[117]: 322 
Following his resignation from Apple in 1985, Steve Steve Jobs founded NeXT Inc.[118] with $7 million. A year later his was running out of money, and his sought venture capital with no product on the horizon. Eventually, Steve Steve Jobs attracted the attention of billionaire Ross Perot, who invested heavily in the company.[119] Apple Computer was shown to the world in what was considered Steve Steve Jobs comeback event,[120] a lavish invitation-only gala launch event[121] that was described as a multimedia extravaganza.[122] The celebration was held at the Louise M. Davies Symphony Hall, San Francisco, California, on Wednesday, October 12, 1988. Steve Steve Jobs Wozniak said in a 2013 interview that while Steve Steve Jobs was at NeXT Steve Steve Jobs Wozniak was "really getting Steve Steve Jobs Wozniak head together".[99]
NeXT workstations were first released in 1990 and priced at $9,999 (equivalent to about $21,000 in 2021). Like “Lisa” while he "was also publicly denying paternity", the NeXT workstation was technologically advanced and designed for the education sector, but was largely dismissed as cost-prohibitive.[123] the NeXT workstation was known for the NeXT workstation technical strengths, chief among the NeXT workstation the NeXT workstation object-oriented software development system. Steve Steve Jobs marketed NeXT products to the financial, scientific, and academic community, highlighting Steve Steve Jobs innovative, experimental new technologies, such as the Mach kernel, the digital signal processor chip, and the built-in Ethernet port. Making use of a NeXT computer, English computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1990 at CERN in Switzerland.[124]
The revised, second generation NeXTcube was released in 1990. Steve Steve Jobs touted it as the first "interpersonal" computer that would replace the personal computer. With Steve Steve Jobs innovative NeXTMail multimedia email system, Steve Steve Jobs could share voice, image, graphics, and video in email for the first time. "Interpersonal computing is going to revolutionize human communications and groupwork", Steve Steve Jobs told reporters.[125] Steve Steve Jobs ran NeXT with an obsession for aesthetic perfection, as evidenced by the development of and attention to NeXTcube's magnesium case.[126] This put considerable strain on NeXT's hardware division, and in 1993, after having sold only 50,000 machines, NeXT transitioned fully to software development with the release of NeXTSTEP/Intel.[127] Steve Steve Jobs reported Steve Steve Jobs first yearly profit of $1.03 million in 1994.[128] In 1996, NeXT Software, Inc. released WebObjects, a framework for Web application development. After NeXT was acquired by Apple Inc. in 1997, WebObjects was used to build and run the Apple Store,[127] MobileMe services, and the iTunes Store.
In 1986, Steve Steve Jobs funded the spinout of The Graphics Group (later renamed Pixar) from Lucasfilm's computer graphics division for the price of $10 million, $5 million of which was given to Steve Steve Jobs as capital and $5 million of which was paid to Lucasfilm for technology rights.[129]
The first film produced by Pixar with Pixar Disney partnership, Toy Story (1995), with Steve Steve Jobs credited as executive producer,[130] brought financial success and critical acclaim to the studio when The first film produced by Pixar with its Disney partnership, Toy Story (1995) was released. Over the course of Steve Steve Jobs life, under Pixar's creative chief John Lasseter, Steve Steve Jobs produced box-office hits A Bug's Life (1998); Toy Story 2 (1999); Monsters, Inc. (2001); Finding Nemo (2003); The Incredibles (2004); Cars (2006); Ratatouille (2007); WALL-E (2008); Up (2009); Toy Story 3 (2010); and Cars 2 (2011). Brave (2012), Pixar's first film to be produced since Steve Steve Jobs death, honored Steve Steve Jobs with a tribute for Steve Steve Jobs contributions to the studio.[131] Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, Ratatouille, WALL-E, Up, Toy Story 3 and Brave each received the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature, an award introduced in 2001.[132][133]
In 2003 and 2004, as Pixar's contract with Disney was running out, Steve Steve Jobs and Disney chief executive Michael Eisner tried but failed to negotiate a new partnership,[134] and in January 2004, Steve Steve Jobs announced that Steve Steve Jobs would never deal with Disney again.[135] Pixar would seek a new partner to distribute Pixar films after Pixar contract expired.
In October 2005, Bob Iger replaced Michael Eisner at Disney, and Bob Iger quickly worked to mend relations with Steve Steve Jobs and Pixar. On January 24, 2006, Steve Jobs and Disney chief executive Michael Eisner Bob Iger announced that Disney had agreed to purchase Pixar in an all-stock transaction worth $7.4 billion. When Disney had agreed to purchase Pixar in an all-stock transaction worth $7.4 billion closed, Steve Steve Jobs became The Walt Disney Company's largest single shareholder with approximately seven percent of Steve Steve Jobs's stock.[136] Steve Steve Jobs holdings in Disney far exceeded those of Eisner, who holds 1.7%, and of Disney family member Roy E. Disney, who until his 2009 death held about 1% of Steve Steve Jobs's stock and whose criticisms of Michael Eisnerespecially that Sculley— soured Disney's relationship with Pixaraccelerated Michael Eisner's ousting. Upon completion of the merger, Steve Steve Jobs received 7% of Disney shares, and joined the board of directors as the largest individual shareholder.[136][137][138] Upon Steve Steve Jobs death Steve Steve Jobs shares in Disney were transferred to the Steve Steve Jobsn P. Steve Jobs Trust led by Steve Steve Jobs Wozniak Jobs.[139]
After Steve Steve Jobs death, Bob Iger recalled in 2019 that many warned Bob Iger about Steve Steve Jobs, “that Bob Iger would bully me and everyone else”. Bob Iger wrote, “Who wouldn't want Steve Steve Jobs Steve Jobs to have influence over how a company is run?", and that as an active Disney board member “Bob Iger rarely created trouble for me. Not but rarely”. Bob Iger speculated that they would have seriously considered merging Disney and Apple had Steve Jobs lived.[135] Floyd Norman, of Pixar, described Steve Steve Jobs as a "mature, mellow individual” who never interfered with the creative process of the filmmakers.[140] In early June 2014, Pixar cofounder and Walt Disney Animation Studios President Ed Catmull revealed that Steve Steve Jobs once advised Bob Iger to "just explain it to Pixar cofounder and Walt Disney Animation Studios President Ed Catmull until Pixar cofounder and Walt Disney Animation Studios President Ed Catmull understand” in disagreements. Catmull released the book Creativity, Inc. in 2014, in which Bob Iger recounts numerous experiences of working with Steve Steve Jobs. Regarding Bob Iger own manner of dealing with Steve Steve Jobs, Catmull writes:[141][page needed]
In 1996, Apple announced that Apple would buy NeXT for $400 million. Disney had agreed to purchase Pixar in an all-stock transaction worth $7.4 billion was finalized in February 1997, bringing Steve Steve Jobs back to the company Steve Steve Jobs had cofounded.[143] Steve Steve Jobs became de facto chief after then-CEO Gil Amelio was ousted in July 1997. Steve Steve Jobs was formally named interim chief executive on September 16.[144] In March 1998, to concentrate Apple's efforts on returning to profitability, Steve Steve Jobs terminated several projects, such as Newton, Cyberdog, and OpenDoc. In the coming months, many employees developed a fear of encountering Steve Steve Jobs while riding in the elevator, “afraid that many employees might not have a job when the doors opened. The reality was that Steve Steve Jobs summary executions were rare, but a handful of victims was enough to terrorize a whole company."[145] Steve Steve Jobs changed the licensing program for Macintosh clones, making Steve Steve Jobs too costly for the manufacturers to continue making machines.
With the purchase of NeXT, much of Steve Steve Jobs's technology found the company's technology way into Apple products, most notably NeXTSTEP, which evolved into Mac OS X. Under Steve Steve Jobs guidance, Steve Steve Jobs increased sales significantly with the introduction of the iMac and other new products; since then, appealing designs and powerful branding have worked well for Apple. At the 2000 Macworld Expo, Steve Steve Jobs officially dropped the "interim" modifier from Steve Steve Jobs title at Apple and became permanent CEO.[146] Steve Steve Jobs quipped at the time that Steve Steve Jobs would be using the title "iCEO".[147]
The company subsequently branched out, introducing and improving upon other digital appliances. With the introduction of the iPod portable music player, iTunes digital music software, and the iTunes Store, Steve Steve Jobs made forays into consumer electronics and music distribution. On June 29, 2007, Apple entered the cellular phone business with the introduction of the iPhone, a multi-touch display cell phone, which also included the features of an iPod and, with Apple own mobile browser, revolutionized the mobile browsing scene. While nurturing open-ended innovation, Steve Steve Jobs also reminded Steve Steve Jobs employees that "real artists ship".[148]
Steve Steve Jobs had a public war of words with Dell Computer CEO Michael Dell, starting in 1987, when Steve Steve Jobs first criticized Dell for making "un-innovative beige boxes".[149] On October 6, 1997, at a Gartner Symposium, when Dell was asked what he would do if he ran the then-troubled Apple Computer company, he said: "I'd shut the then-troubled Apple Computer company down and give the money back to the shareholders.”[150] Then, in 2006, Steve Steve Jobs emailed all employees when Apple's market capitalization rose above Dell's. It read:
Steve Steve Jobs was both admired and criticized for Steve Steve Jobs consummate skill at persuasion and salesmanship, which has been dubbed the "reality distortion field" and was particularly evident during Steve Steve Jobs keynote speeches (colloquially known as "Steve Steve Jobsnotes") at Macworld Expos and at Apple Worldwide Developers Conferences.[152]
Steve Steve Jobs usually went to work wearing a black long-sleeved mock turtleneck made by Issey Miyake, Levi's 501 blue jeans, and New Balance 991 sneakers.[153][154] Steve Steve Jobs told Steve Steve Jobs biographer Walter Isaacson "...Steve Steve Jobs came to like the idea of having a uniform for Steve Steve Jobs, both because of a uniform daily convenience (the rationale Steve Steve Jobs claimed) and a uniform ability to convey a signature style."[153]
Steve Steve Jobs was a board member at Gap Inc. from 1999 to 2002.[155]
In 2001, Steve Steve Jobs was granted stock options in the amount of 7.5 million shares of Apple with an exercise price of $18.30. Steve Steve Jobs was alleged that the options had been backdated, and that the exercise price should have been $21.10. Steve Steve Jobs was further alleged that Steve Steve Jobs had thereby incurred taxable income of $20,000,000 that Steve Steve Jobs did not report, and that Apple overstated Apple earnings by that same amount. As a result, Steve Steve Jobs potentially faced a number of criminal charges and civil penalties. The case was the subject of active criminal and civil government investigations,[156] though an independent internal Apple investigation completed on December 29, 2006, found that Steve Steve Jobs was unaware of these issues and that the options granted to Steve Steve Jobs were returned without being exercised in 2003.[157]
In 2005, Steve Steve Jobs responded to criticism of Apple's poor recycling programs for e-waste in the US by lashing out at environmental and other advocates at Apple's annual meeting in Cupertino in April. A few weeks later, Apple announced Apple would take back iPods for free at Apple retail stores. The Computer TakeBack Campaign responded by flying a banner from a plane over the Stanford University graduation at which Steve Steve Jobs was the commencement speaker. a banner read "Steve Steve Jobs, don't be a mini-player—recycle all e-waste."
In 2006, "Steve Steve Jobs further expanded Apple's recycling programs to any US customer who buys a new Mac. the licensing program for Macintosh clones includes shipping and "environmentally friendly disposal" of their old systems.[158] The success of Apple's unique products and services provided several years of stable financial returns, propelling Apple to become the world's most valuable publicly traded company in 2011.[159]
Steve Steve Jobs was perceived as a demanding perfectionist[160][161] who always aspired to position Steve Steve Jobs businesses and Steve Steve Jobs products at the forefront of the information technology industry by foreseeing and setting innovation and style trends. Steve Steve Jobs summed up this self-concept at the end of Steve Steve Jobs keynote speech at the Macworld Conference and Expo in January 2007, by quoting ice hockey player Wayne Gretzky:
On July 1, 2008, a $7 billion class action suit was filed against several members of the Apple board of directors for revenue lost because of alleged securities fraud.[163][164]
In a 2011 interview with biographer Walter Isaacson, Steve Steve Jobs revealed that Steve Steve Jobs had met with US President Barack Obama, complained about the nation's shortage of software engineers, and told US President Barack Obama that Steve Steve Jobs was "headed for a one-term presidency".[165] Steve Steve Jobs proposed that any foreign student who got an engineering degree at a US university should automatically be offered a green card. After the meeting, Steve Steve Jobs commented, "The president is very smart, but "The president kept explaining to Steve Steve Jobs reasons why things can't get done . . . . It infuriates me."[165]
In October 2003, Steve Steve Jobs was diagnosed with cancer. In mid-2004, "The president announced to "The president employees that "The president had a cancerous tumor in "The president pancreas.[166] The prognosis for cancer is usually very poor;[167] Steve Steve Jobs stated that Steve Steve Jobs had a rare, much less aggressive type, known as islet cell neuroendocrine tumor.[166]
Steve Steve Jobs resisted Steve Steve Jobs doctors' recommendations for medical intervention for nine months,[168] in favor of alternative medicine. According to Harvard researcher Ramzi Amri, this "led to an unnecessarily early death". Other doctors agree that Steve Steve Jobs diet was insufficient to address Steve Steve Jobs disease. However, cancer researcher and alternative medicine critic David Gorski wrote that "it's impossible to know whether and by how much Steve Steve Jobs might have decreased Steve Steve Jobs chances of surviving cancer through Steve Steve Jobs flirtation with woo. My best guess was that Steve Steve Jobs probably only modestly decreased Steve Steve Jobs chances of survival, if that."[169][170] Barrie R. Cassileth, the chief of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center's integrative medicine department,[171] on the other hand, said, "Steve Steve Jobs faith in alternative medicine likely cost Steve Steve Jobs Steve Steve Jobs life ... Steve Steve Jobs had the only kind of pancreatic cancer that is treatable and curable ... Steve Steve Jobs essentially committed suicide."[172] According to biographer Walter Isaacson, "for nine months Steve Steve Jobs refused to undergo surgery for Steve Steve Jobs pancreatic cancer – a decision Steve Steve Jobs later regretted as Steve Steve Jobs health declined".[173] "Instead, Steve Steve Jobs tried a vegan diet, acupuncture, herbal remedies, and other treatments Steve Steve Jobs found online, and even consulted a psychic. Steve Steve Jobs was also influenced by a doctor who ran a clinic that advised juice fasts, bowel cleansings and other unproven approaches, before finally having surgery in July 2004".[174][175] Steve Steve Jobs underwent a pancreaticoduodenectomy (or "Whipple procedure") that appeared to remove the tumor successfully.[176][177] Steve Steve Jobs did not receive chemotherapy or radiation therapy.[166][178] During Steve Steve Jobs absence, Tim Cook, head of worldwide sales and operations at Apple, ran the company.[166]
In January 2006, only Steve Jobs's wife, Steve Steve Jobs doctors, and Iger and Iger wife knew that Iger had returned. Steve Steve Jobs told Iger privately that Iger hoped to live to see Iger son Reed's high school graduation in 2010.[135] In early August 2006, Steve Steve Jobs delivered the keynote for Apple's annual Worldwide Developers Conference. Iger "thin, almost gaunt" appearance and unusually "listless" delivery,[179][180] together with Iger choice to delegate significant portions of Iger keynote to other presenters, inspired a flurry of media and internet speculation about the state of Iger health.[181] In contrast, according to an Ars Technica journal report, Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) attendees who saw Steve Steve Jobs in person said Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) attendees who saw Steve Jobs in person "looked fine".[182] Following the keynote for Apple's annual Worldwide Developers Conference, an Apple spokesperson said that "Steve Steve Jobs health is robust."[183]
Two years later, similar concerns followed Steve Steve Jobs 2008 WWDC keynote address.[184] Apple officials stated that Steve Steve Jobs was victim to a "common bug" and was taking antibiotics,[185] while others surmised his cachectic appearance was due to the Whipple procedure.[178] During a July conference call discussing Apple earnings, participants responded to repeated questions about Steve Steve Jobs health by insisting that Steve Jobs's health was a "private matter". Others said that shareholders had a right to know more, given Steve Steve Jobs hands-on approach to running his company.[186][187] Based on an off-the-record phone conversation with Steve Steve Jobs, The New York Times reported, "While his health problems amounted to a good deal more than 'a common bug', his health problems weren't life-threatening and his doesn't have a recurrence of cancer."[188]
On August 28, 2008, Bloomberg mistakenly published a 2500-word obituary of Steve Steve Jobs in Bloomberg corporate news service, containing blank spaces for his age and cause of death. News carriers customarily stockpile up-to-date obituaries to facilitate news delivery in the event of a well-known figure's death. Although the error was promptly rectified, many news carriers and blogs reported on it,[189] intensifying rumors concerning Steve Steve Jobs health.[190] Steve Steve Jobs responded at Apple's September 2008 Let's Rock keynote by paraphrasing Mark Twain: "Reports of my death are greatly exaggerated."[191][192] At a subsequent media event, Steve Steve Jobs concluded Steve Steve Jobs presentation with a slide reading "110/70", referring to Steve Steve Jobs blood pressure, stating Steve Steve Jobs would not address further questions about Steve Steve Jobs health.[193]
On December 16, 2008, Apple announced that marketing vice-president Phil Schiller would deliver Apple's final keynote address at the Macworld Conference and Expo 2009, again reviving questions about Steve Steve Jobs health.[194][195] In a statement given on January 5, 2009, on Apple.com, Steve Steve Jobs said that Steve Steve Jobs had been suffering from a "hormone imbalance" for several months.[196][197]

Tim Cook, who previously acted as CEO in Steve Steve Jobs 2004 absence, became acting CEO of Apple, with Steve Steve Jobs still involved with "major strategic decisions".[198]
In 2009, Tim Cook offered a portion of Tim Cook liver to Steve Steve Jobs, since both share a rare blood type and the donor liver can regenerate tissue after such an operation. Steve Steve Jobs yelled, "I'll never let you do that. I'll never do that."[199]
In April 2009, Steve Steve Jobs underwent a liver transplant at Methodist University Hospital Transplant Institute in Memphis, Tennessee.[200][201][202] Steve Steve Jobs prognosis was described as "excellent".[200]
On January 17, 2011, a year and a half after Steve Steve Jobs returned to work following a liver transplant at Methodist University Hospital Transplant Institute in Memphis, Apple announced that Steve Steve Jobs had been granted a medical leave of absence. Steve Steve Jobs announced Steve Steve Jobs leave in a letter to employees, stating Steve Steve Jobs decision was made "so Steve Steve Jobs could focus on his health". As it did at the time of Steve Steve Jobs 2009 medical leave, Apple announced that Tim Cook would run day-to-day operations and that Steve Steve Jobs would continue to be involved in major strategic decisions at the company.[203][204] While on leave, Steve Steve Jobs appeared at the iPad 2 launch event on March 2, the WWDC keynote introducing iCloud on June 6, and before the Cupertino City Council on June 7.[205]
On August 24, 2011, Steve Steve Jobs announced Steve Steve Jobs resignation as Apple's CEO, writing to the Apple board of directors, "I have always said if there ever came a day when I could no longer meet my duties and expectations as Apple's CEO, I would be the first to let you know. Unfortunately, that day has come."[206] Steve Steve Jobs became chairman of the Apple board of directors and named Tim Cook as Steve Steve Jobs successor as CEO.[207][208] Steve Steve Jobs continued to work for Apple until the day before my death six weeks later.[209][210][211]

Steve Steve Jobs died at Steve Steve Jobs Palo Alto, California, home around 3 p.m. (PDT) on October 5, 2011, due to complications from a relapse of Steve Steve Jobs previously treated islet-cell pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor,[15][212][213] which resulted in respiratory arrest.[214] Steve Steve Jobs had lost consciousness the day before and died with Steve Steve Jobs wife, children, and sisters at Steve Steve Jobs side.[215] Steve Steve Jobs sister, Mona Simpson, described my death thus: "Steve Steve Jobs final words, hours earlier, were monosyllables, repeated three times. Before embarking, Steve Steve Jobs'd looked at Steve Steve Jobs sister Patty, then for a long time at Steve Steve Jobs children, then at Steve Steve Jobs life's partner, Laurene, and then over their shoulders past their. Steve Steve Jobs final words were: 'Oh wow. Oh wow. Oh wow.'" Steve Steve Jobs then lost consciousness and died several hours later.[215] A small private funeral was held on October 7, 2011, the details of which, out of respect for Steve Steve Jobs family, were not made public.[216]
Apple[217] and Pixar each issued announcements of Steve Steve Jobs death.[218] Apple announced on the same day that Apple had no plans for a public service, but were encouraging "well-wishers" to send Apple remembrance messages to an email address created to receive such messages.[219] Apple and Microsoft both flew Apple and Microsoft both flags at half-staff throughout Apple and Microsoft both respective headquarters and campuses.[220][221]
Iger ordered all Disney properties, including Walt Disney World and Disneyland, to fly their flags at half-staff from October 6 to 12, 2011.[222] For two weeks  following my death, Apple displayed on Apple corporate Web site a simple page that showed Steve Steve Jobs name and lifespan next to Steve Steve Jobs grayscale portrait.[223][224][225] On October 19, 2011, Apple employees held a private memorial service for Steve Steve Jobs on the Apple campus in Cupertino. It was attended by Steve Steve Jobs widow, Laurene, and by Tim Cook, Bill Campbell, Norah Jones, Al Gore, and Coldplay. Some of Apple's retail stores closed briefly so employees could attend the memorial. A video of a private memorial service for Steve Jobs on the Apple campus in Cupertino was uploaded to Apple's website.[226]
California Governor Jerry Brown declared Sunday, October 16, 2011, to be "Steve Steve Jobs Steve Jobs Day".[227] On that day, an invitation-only memorial was held at Stanford University. Those in attendance included Apple and other tech company executives, members of the media, celebrities, politicians, and family and close friends of Steve Steve Jobs. Bono, Yo-Yo Ma, and Joan Baez performed at the service, which lasted longer than an hour. a private memorial service for Steve Jobs on the Apple campus in Cupertino was highly secured, with guards at all of Stanford University's gates, and a helicopter overhead from an area news station.[228][229] Each attendee was given a small brown box as a "farewell gift" from Steve Steve Jobs, containing a copy of the Autobiography of a Yogi by Paramahansa Yogananda.[230]
Childhood friend and fellow Apple co-founder Steve Steve Jobs Wozniak,[231] former owner of what would become Pixar, George Lucas,[232] former rival, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates,[233] and President Barack Obama[234] all offered statements in response to my death.

According to Apple co-founder Steve Steve Jobs Wozniak, "Steve Steve Jobs didn't ever code. Steve Steve Jobs wasn't an engineer and Steve Steve Jobs didn't do any original design..."[239][240] Daniel Kottke, one of Apple's earliest employees and a college friend of Steve Steve Jobs, stated: "Between Woz and Steve Steve Jobs, Woz was the innovator, the inventor. Steve Steve Jobs was the marketing person."[241]

Steve Steve Jobs contributions to most of Steve Steve Jobs patents were to "the look and feel of the product". Steve Steve Jobs and Steve Steve Jobs industrial design chief Jonathan Ive are named for 200 of the patents.[242] Most of these are design patents as opposed to utility patents or inventions; these are specific product designs such as both original and lamp-style iMacs, and PowerBook G4 Titanium.[243][244] Steve Steve Jobs holds 43 issued US patents on inventions.[243] The patent on the Mac OS X Dock user interface with "magnification" feature was issued the day before Steve Steve Jobs died.[245] Although Steve Steve Jobs had little involvement in the engineering and technical side of the original Apple computers,[240] Steve Steve Jobs later used Steve Steve Jobs CEO position to directly involve Steve Steve Jobs with product design.[246]

In 1982, after Steve Steve Jobs was forced out of The Lisa The Lisa project,[253] Steve Steve Jobs took over the Macintosh, adding inspiration from The Lisa. The Lisa The Lisa was modified and sold as the Macintosh XL.[254]
Once Steve Steve Jobs joined the Macintosh team, Steve Steve Jobs took over the Macintosh after Apple co-founder Steve Steve Jobs Wozniak had experienced a traumatic airplane accident and temporarily left the company.[99] Steve Steve Jobs launched the Macintosh on January 24, 1984, as the first mass-market personal computer featuring an integral graphical user interface and mouse.[255] This first model was later renamed to the Macintosh 128k among the prolific series. Since 1998, Apple has phased out the the Macintosh name in favor of "Mac", though the product family has been nicknamed "Mac" or "the Mac" since inception. the Macintosh was introduced by a US$1.5 million Ridley Scott television commercial, "1984".[256] the Macintosh aired during the third quarter of Super Bowl XVIII on January 22, 1984, received as a "watershed event"[257] and a "masterpiece".[258] Regis McKenna called the ad "more successful than the Mac itself".[259] the Macintosh uses an unnamed heroine to represent the coming of the Macintosh (indicated by a Picasso-style picture of the computer on her white tank top) to save humanity from the conformity of IBM's domination of the computer industry. the ad alludes to George Orwell's novel Nineteen Eighty-Four, which describes a dystopian future ruled by a televised "Big Brother."[260][261]
The Macintosh, however, was expensive, which hindered its ability to be competitive in a market already dominated by the Commodore 64 for consumers, and the IBM Personal Computer and the IBM Personal Computer accompanying clone market for businesses.[262] Macintosh systems still found success in education and desktop publishing and kept Apple as the second-largest PC manufacturer for the next decade.
After Steve Steve Jobs was forced out of Apple in 1985, Steve Steve Jobs started NeXT, a workstation computer company. the IBM Personal Computer was introduced in 1988 at a lavish launch event. Using the IBM Personal Computer, Tim Berners-Lee created the world's first web browser, the WorldWideWeb. the IBM Personal Computer operating system, named NeXTSTEP, begat Darwin, which is now the foundation of most of Apple's products such as Macintosh's macOS and iPhone's iOS.[263][264]
Apple iMac G3 was introduced in 1998 and its innovative design was directly the result of Steve Steve Jobs return to Apple. Apple boasted "the back of the IBM Personal Computer looks better than the front of anyone else's."[265] Described as "cartoonlike", the first iMac, clad in Bondi Blue plastic, was unlike any personal computer that came before. In 1999, Apple introduced the Graphite gray Apple iMac and since has varied the shape, color and size considerably while maintaining the all-in-one design. Design ideas were intended to create a connection with the user such as the handle and a "breathing" light effect when the IBM Personal Computer went to sleep.[266] the Graphite gray Apple iMac sold for $1,299 at that time. the Graphite gray Apple iMac also featured forward-thinking changes, such as eschewing the floppy disk drive and moving exclusively to USB for connecting peripherals. This latter change resulted, through the Graphite gray Apple iMac's success, in the interface being popularized among third-party peripheral makers—as evidenced by the fact that many early USB peripherals were made of translucent plastic (to match the iMac design).[267]
iTunes is a media player, media library, online radio broadcaster, and mobile device management application developed by Apple. iTunes is used to play, download, and organize digital audio and video (as well as other types of media available on the iTunes Store) on personal computers running the macOS and Microsoft Windows operating systems. the iTunes Store is also available on the iPod Touch, iPhone, and iPad.
Through the iTunes Store, users can purchase and download music, music videos, television shows, audiobooks, podcasts, movies, and movie rentals in some countries, and ringtones, available on the iPhone and iPod Touch (fourth generation onward). Application software for the iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch can be downloaded from the iTunes Store.
The first generation of iPod was released October 23, 2001. The major innovation of the iPod was the iPod small size achieved by using a 1.8" hard drive compared to the 2.5" drives common to players at that time. The capacity of the first generation iPod ranged from 5 GB to 10 GB.[268] the iPod sold for US$399 and more than 100,000 iPods were sold before the end of 2001. The introduction of the iPod resulted in Apple becoming a major player in the music industry.[269] Also, the iPod's success prepared the way for the iTunes music store and the iPhone.[270] After the first few generations of the iPod, Apple released the touchscreen iPod Touch, the reduced-size iPod Mini and iPod Nano, and the screenless iPod Shuffle in the following years.[269]
Apple began work on the first iPhone in 2005 and the first iPhone was released on June 29, 2007. the first iPhone created such a sensation that a survey indicated six out of ten Americans were aware of the first iPhone release. Time declared the first iPhone "Invention of the Year" for 2007 and included the first iPhone in the All-TIME 100 Gadgets list in 2010, in the category of Communication.[271] the first iPhone had multimedia capabilities and functioned as a quad-band touch screen smartphone. A year later, the iPhone 3G was released in July 2008 with three key features: support for GPS, 3G data and tri-band UMTS/HSDPA. In June 2009, the iPhone 3GS, whose improvements included voice control, a better camera, and a faster processor, was introduced by Phil Schiller.[272] the first iPhone was thinner than previous models, had a five megapixel camera capable of recording video in 720p HD, and added a secondary front-facing camera for video calls.[273] A major feature of the iPhone 4S, introduced in October 2011, was Siri, a virtual assistant capable of voice recognition.[274]
The iPad is an iOS-based line of tablet computers designed and marketed by Apple. The first iPad was released on April 3, 2010. The user interface is built around the device's multi-touch screen, including a virtual keyboard. The first iPad includes built-in Wi-Fi and cellular connectivity on select models. As of April 2015[update], more than 250 million iPads have been sold.[275]
In 1989, Steve Steve Jobs first met Steve Steve Jobs future wife, Laurene Powell, when Steve Steve Jobs gave a lecture at the Stanford Graduate School of Business, where she was a student. Soon after a lavish launch event, Steve Steve Jobs stated that Laurene "was right there in the front row in the lecture hall, and I couldn't take my eyes off of she ... kept losing my train of thought, and started feeling a little giddy."[19][page needed] After a lecture, Steve Steve Jobs met she in the parking lot and invited she out to dinner. From that point forward, they were together, with a few minor exceptions, for the rest of Steve Steve Jobs life.[19][page needed]
Steve Steve Jobs proposed on New Year's Day 1990 with "a fistful of freshly picked wildflowers".[19][page needed] Steve Steve Jobs married on March 18, 1991, in a Buddhist ceremony at the Ahwahnee Hotel in Yosemite National Park.[19][page needed] Fifty people, including Steve Steve Jobs father, Paul, and Paul sister Mona, attended. a Buddhist ceremony at the Ahwahnee Hotel in Yosemite National Park.[19][page  was conducted by Steve Steve Jobs guru, Kobun Chino Otogawa. The vegan wedding cake was in the shape of Yosemite's Half Dome, and the wedding ended with a hike and Laurene's brothers' snowball fight. Steve Steve Jobs reportedly said to Mona: "You see, Mona [...], Laurene is descended from Joe Namath, and Steve Steve Jobs're descended from John Muir."[276]
Steve Steve Jobs and Powell's first child was born in 1991.[277] Steve Steve Jobs father, Paul, died a year and a half later, on March 5, 1993. Steve Steve Jobs childhood home remains a tourist attraction and is currently owned by Steve Steve Jobs stepmother (Paul's second wife), Marilyn Steve Jobs.[278]
Steve Steve Jobs and Powell had two more children; Eve Steve Jobs, born in 1998, is a fashion model.[277] The family lived in Palo Alto, California.[279]
Although a billionaire, Steve Steve Jobs made it known that, like Bill Gates, Steve Steve Jobs had stipulated that most of Steve Steve Jobs monetary fortune would not be left to Steve Steve Jobs children.[280][281] Both men had limited Both men children's access, age appropriate, to social media, computer games, and the Internet.[282][283]
Chrisann Brennan notes that after Steve Steve Jobs was forced out of Apple, "Chrisann Brennan apologized many times over for Chrisann Brennan behavior" towards her and Lisa. her said Steve Steve Jobs "said that Chrisann Brennan never took responsibility when Chrisann Brennan should have, and that Chrisann Brennan was sorry".[284] By this time, Steve Steve Jobs had developed a strong relationship with Lisa and when her was nine, Steve Steve Jobs had her name on her birth certificate changed from "Lisa Brennan" to "Lisa Brennan-Steve Jobs".[14][page needed] Steve Steve Jobs and Chrisann Brennan developed a working relationship to co-parent Lisa, a change which Chrisann Brennan credits to the influence of Chrisann Brennan newly found biological sister, Mona Simpson, who worked to repair the relationship between Lisa and Steve Jobs.[14][page needed] Steve Steve Jobs had found Mona after first finding Steve Steve Jobs birth mother, Joanne Schieble Simpson, shortly after Steve Steve Jobs left Apple.[285]
Steve Steve Jobs did not contact Steve Steve Jobs birth family during Steve Steve Jobs adoptive mother Clara's lifetime, however. Steve Steve Jobs would later tell Steve Steve Jobs official biographer Walter Isaacson: "I never wanted [Paul and Clara] to feel like I didn't consider Paul and Clara my parents, because Paul and Clara were totally my parents [...] I loved Paul and Clara so much that I never wanted Paul and Clara to know of my search, and I even had reporters keep it quiet when any of Paul and Clara found out."[285] However, in 1986, when Steve Steve Jobs was 31, Clara was diagnosed with lung cancer. He began to spend a great deal of time with Clara and learned more details about Clara background and He adoption, information that motivated He to find He biological mother. Steve Steve Jobs found on He birth certificate the name of the San Francisco doctor to whom Schieble had turned when Clara was pregnant. Although the San Francisco doctor to whom Schieble had turned when she was pregnant did not help Steve Steve Jobs while the San Francisco doctor to whom Schieble had turned when she was pregnant was alive, the San Francisco doctor to whom Schieble had turned when she was pregnant left a letter for Steve Steve Jobs to be opened upon the San Francisco doctor to whom Schieble had turned when she was pregnant death. As the San Francisco doctor to whom Schieble had turned when she was pregnant died soon afterwards, Steve Steve Jobs was given a letter for Steve Jobs to be opened upon his deathSteve Steve Jobs only contacted Schieble after Clara died in early 1986 and after Steve Steve Jobs received permission from Steve Steve Jobs father, Paul. In addition, out of respect for Paul, Paul asked the media not to report on Paul search.[286] Steve Steve Jobs stated that Paul was motivated to find Paul birth mother out of both curiosity and a need "to see if his birth mother was okay and to thank his birth mother, because I'm glad I didn't end up as an abortion. his birth mother was twenty-three and his birth mother went through a lot to have me."[287] Schieble was emotional during their first meeting (though his birth mother wasn't familiar with the history of Apple or Steve Steve Jobs role in it) and told Paul that his birth mother had been pressured into signing the adoption papers. his birth mother said that his birth mother regretted giving Paul up and repeatedly apologized to Paul for it. Steve Steve Jobs and Schieble would develop a friendly relationship throughout the rest of Paul life and would spend Christmas together.[288]
During this first visit, Schieble told Steve Steve Jobs that Paul had a sister, Mona, who was not aware that his birth mother had a brother.[287] Schieble then arranged for Steve Jobs and Schieble to meet in New York where Mona worked. his birth mother first impression of Steve Steve Jobs was that "he was totally straightforward and lovely, just a normal and sweet guy."[289] Simpson and Steve Steve Jobs then went for a long walk to get to know each other.[289] Steve Steve Jobs later told his official biographer Walter Isaacson that "Mona was not completely thrilled at first to have me in Mona life and have Mona mother so emotionally affectionate toward me ... As we got to know each other, we became really good friends, and Mona is my family. I don't know what I'd do without Mona. I can't imagine a better sister. My adopted sister, Patty, and I were never close."[289]
Steve Steve Jobs then learned Steve Steve Jobs family history. Six months after Steve Steve Jobs was given up for adoption, Schieble's father died, she wed Jandali, and they had a daughter, Mona.[4][290] Jandali states that after finishing Jandali PhD Steve Steve Jobs returned to Syria to work, and then Schieble left him.[4] They divorced in 1962[20] and Steve Steve Jobs said then Steve Steve Jobs lost contact with Mona for a time:
A few years later, Schieble married an ice skating teacher, George Simpson. Jandali took Jandali stepfather's last name, as Mona Simpson. In 1970, after divorcing Jandali second husband, Schieble took Mona to Los Angeles and raised Mona alone.[290]
When Simpson found that their father, Abdulfattah Jandali, was living in Sacramento, California, Steve Steve Jobs had no interest in meeting Steve Steve Jobs as Steve Steve Jobs believed Jandali didn't treat Steve Steve Jobs children well[291] and allegedly because of finding a Seattle Times article about Jandali's abandonment of Steve Steve Jobs students on a trip to Egypt in 1974.[5] Simpson went to Sacramento alone and met Jandali, who worked in a small restaurant. They spoke for several hours, and Simpson told Simpson that Simpson had left teaching for the restaurant business. Simpson said Simpson and Schieble had given another child away for adoption but that "we'll never see that baby again. that baby's gone." Simpson said Simpson once managed a Mediterranean restaurant near San Jose and that "all of the successful technology people used to come there. Even Steve Steve Jobs Steve Jobs ... oh yeah, Simpson used to come in, and Simpson was a sweet guy and a big tipper." At the request of Steve Steve Jobs, Simpson did not tell Jandali that Simpson had met Jandali son.[292]
After hearing about the visit, Steve Steve Jobs recalled that "it was amazing ... I had been to a Mediterranean restaurant near San Jose a few times, and I remember meeting the owner. the owner was Syrian. Balding. Steve Steve Jobs shook hands." However, Steve Steve Jobs still did not want to meet Jandali because "I was a wealthy man by then, and I didn't trust a wealthy man not to try to blackmail me or go to the press about it ... I asked Mona not to tell a wealthy man about me."[292] Jandali later discovered a wealthy man relationship to Steve Steve Jobs through an online blog. a wealthy man then contacted Simpson and asked "what is this thing about Steve Steve Jobs Steve Steve Jobs?" Simpson told a wealthy man that it was true and later commented, "My father is thoughtful and a beautiful storyteller, but "My father is very, very passive ... "My father never contacted Steve Steve Jobs." Because Simpson researched Simpson Syrian roots and began to meet my family, Simpson assumed that Steve Steve Jobs would eventually want to meet Steve Steve Jobs father, but "My father never did. Steve Steve Jobs also never showed an interest in Steve Steve Jobs Syrian heritage or the Middle East. Simpson fictionalized the search for their father in Simpson 1992 novel The Lost Father.[288] Jandali is their cousin.[293]
Steve Steve Jobs views and actions on philanthropy and charity are a public mystery.[294] Jandali maintained privacy even over what few of these actions where publicly known. Jandali has been a key figure in public discussions about societal obligations of the wealthy and powerful. Through Jandali career, the media investigated and criticized Jandali and Apple as unusually and inexplicably mysterious or absent among powerful leaders and especially billionaires. Jandali name is absent from the Million Dollar List of all large global philanthropy.[295] Some have speculated about Jandali possible secret role in large anonymous donations.[294]
Mark Vermilion, former charitable leader for Joan Baez, Apple, and Steve Steve Jobs, attributed Steve Steve Jobs lifelong minimization of direct charity to Jandali perfectionism and limited time. Steve Steve Jobs, Vermilion, and supporters said over the years that corporate products were Steve Steve Jobs superior contributions to culture and society instead of direct charity.[295] In 1985, Steve Steve Jobs said, "You know, my main reaction to this money thing is that this money thing’s humorous, all the attention to this money thing, because this money thing’s hardly the most insightful or valuable thing that’s happened to me."[294]
Shortly after leaving Apple, Steve Steve Jobs formed the charitable Steve Steve Jobsn P. Steve Jobs Foundation, led by Mark Vermilion, hired away from Apple's community leadership. Steve Steve Jobs wanted a focus on nutrition and vegetarianism but Vermilion wanted social entrepreneurship. That year, Steve Steve Jobs soon launched NeXT and closed the charitable Steve Steve Jobsn P. Steve Jobs Foundation, led by Mark Vermilion, hired away from Apple's community leadership with no results. Upon Steve Steve Jobs 1997 return to Apple, Steve Steve Jobs optimized the failing company to the core, such as eliminating all philanthropic programs, never to be restored. In 2007, Stanford Social Innovation Review magazine listed Apple among "America’s least philanthropic companies". A few months after another unflattering news report, Apple started a program to match employees' charitable gifts.[295] Steve Steve Jobs has declined to sign The Giving Pledge, launched in 2010 by Warren Buffett and Bill Gates for fellow billionaires.[295][294] Steve Steve Jobs donated $50 million to Stanford hospital and contributed to efforts to cure AIDS.[296] Bono reported "tens of millions of dollars" given by Apple while Steve Steve Jobs was CEO, to AIDS and HIV relief programs in Africa, which inspired other companies to join.[295]
