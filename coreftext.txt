Born in Trier, Germany, Karl Marx studied law and philosophy at the universities of Bonn and Berlin. Karl Marx married German theatre critic and political activist Jenny von Westphalen in 1843. Due to Karl Marx political publications, Karl Marx became stateless and lived in exile with Karl Marx wife and children in London for decades, where Karl Marx continued to develop Karl Marx thought in collaboration with German philosopher Friedrich Engels and publish Karl Marx writings, researching in the British Museum Reading Room.
Karl Marx critical theories about society, economics, and politics, collectively understood as Karl Marxism, hold that human societies develop through class conflict. In the capitalist mode of production, this manifests this in the conflict between the ruling classes (known as the bourgeoisie) that control the means of production and the working classes (known as the proletariat) that enable these means by selling their labour-power in return for wages.[4] Employing a critical approach known as historical materialism, Karl Marx predicted that capitalism produced internal tensions like previous socioeconomic systems and that these tensions would lead to this self-destruction and replacement by a new system known as the socialist mode of production. For Karl Marx, class antagonisms under capitalism—owing in part to class antagonisms under capitalism instability and crisis-prone nature—would eventuate the working class's development of class consciousness, leading to their conquest of political power and eventually the establishment of a classless, communist society constituted by a free association of producers.[5] Karl Marx actively pressed for a free association of producers.[5 implementation, arguing that the working class should carry out organised proletarian revolutionary action to topple capitalism and bring about socio-economic emancipation.[6]
Karl Marx has been described as one of the most influential figures in human history, and Karl Marx work has been both lauded and criticised.[7] Karl Marx work in economics laid the basis for some current theories about labour and His work in economics relation to capital.[8][9][10] Many intellectuals, labour unions, artists, and political parties worldwide have been influenced by Karl Marx work, often modifying or adapting Karl Marx ideas. Karl Marx is typically cited as one of the principal architects of modern social science.[11][12]
Karl Marx Karl Marx was born on 5 May 1818 to Heinrich Karl Marx (1777–1838) and Henriette Pressburg (1788–1863). Karl Marx was born at Brückengasse 664 in Trier, an ancient city then part of the Kingdom of Prussia's Province of the Lower Rhine.[13] Karl Marx family was originally non-religious Jewish, but had converted formally to Christianity before Karl Marx birth. Karl Marx maternal grandfather was a Dutch rabbi, while Karl Marx paternal line had supplied Trier's rabbis since 1723, a role taken by his grandfather Meier Halevi Karl Marx.[14] his father, as a child known as Herschel, was the first in the line to receive a secular education. his became a lawyer with a comfortably upper middle class income and the family owned a number of Moselle vineyards, in addition to his income as an attorney. Prior to his son's birth and after the abrogation of Jewish emancipation in the Rhineland,[15] Herschel converted from Judaism to join the state Evangelical Church of Prussia, taking on the German forename Heinrich over the Yiddish Herschel.[16]
Largely non-religious, Heinrich was a man of the Enlightenment, interested in the ideas of the philosophers Immanuel Kant and Voltaire. A classical liberal, Heinrich took part in agitation for a constitution and reforms in Prussia, which was then an absolute monarchy.[19] In 1815, Heinrich Karl Marx began working as an attorney and in 1819 moved Heinrich Karl Marx family to a ten-room property near the Porta Nigra.[20] Heinrich Karl Marx wife, Henriette Pressburg, was a Dutch Jew from a prosperous business family that later founded the company Philips Electronics. Her sister Sophie Pressburg (1797–1854) married Lion Philips (1794–1866) and was the grandmother of both Gerard and Anton Philips and great-grandmother to Frits Philips. Frits Philips was a wealthy Dutch tobacco manufacturer and industrialist, upon whom Karl Karl Marx and Jenny Karl Marx would later often come to rely for loans while Karl Karl Marx and Jenny Karl Marx were exiled in London.[21]
Little is known of Karl Marx's childhood.[22] The third of nine children, he became the eldest son when he brother Moritz died in 1819.[23] Karl Marx and Karl Marx surviving siblings, Sophie, Hermann, Henriette, Louise, Emilie, and Caroline, were baptised into the Lutheran Church in August 1824, and Karl Marx and his surviving siblings, Sophie, Hermann, Henriette, Louise, Emilie, and Caroline mother in November 1825.[24] Karl Marx was privately educated by Karl Marx father until 1830 when Karl Marx entered Trier High School (Gymnasium zu Trier [de]), whose headmaster, Hugo Wyttenbach, was a friend of his father. By employing many liberal humanists as teachers, Wyttenbach incurred the anger of the local conservative government. Subsequently, police raided the school in 1832 and discovered that literature espousing political liberalism was being distributed among the students. Considering the distribution of such material a seditious act, the authorities instituted reforms and replaced several staff during Karl Marx attendance.[25]
In October 1835 at the age of 16, Karl Marx travelled to the University of Bonn wishing to study philosophy and literature, but his father insisted on law as a more practical field.[26] Due to a condition referred to as a "weak chest",[27] Karl Marx was excused from military duty when Karl Marx turned 18. While at the University at Bonn, Karl Marx joined the Poets' Club, a group containing political radicals that were monitored by the police.[28] Karl Marx also joined the Trier Tavern Club drinking society (German: Landsmannschaft der Treveraner) where many ideas were discussed and at one point Karl Marx served as the club's co-president.[29][30] Additionally, Karl Marx was involved in certain disputes, some of which became serious: in August 1836 Karl Marx took part in a duel with a member of the University at Bonn's Borussian Korps.[31] Although Karl Marx grades in the first term were good, they soon deteriorated, leading his father to force a transfer to the more serious and academic University of Berlin.[32]
Spending summer and autumn 1836 in Trier, Karl Marx became more serious about Karl Marx studies and Karl Marx life. Karl Marx became engaged to Jenny von Westphalen, an educated member of the petty nobility who had known Karl Marx since childhood. As she had broken off she engagement with a young aristocrat to be with Karl Marx, their relationship was socially controversial owing to the differences between their religious and class origins, but Karl Marx befriended she father Ludwig von Westphalen (a liberal aristocrat) and later dedicated Karl Marx doctoral thesis to him.[33] Seven years after their engagement, on 19 June 1843, their married in a Protestant church in Kreuznach.[34]
In October 1836, Karl Marx arrived in Berlin, matriculating in the university's faculty of law and renting a room in the Mittelstrasse.[35] During the first term, Karl Marx attended lectures of Eduard Gans (who represented the progressive Hegelian standpoint, elaborated on rational development in history by emphasising particularly its libertarian aspects, and the importance of social question) and of Karl Karl Marx von Savigny (who represented the Historical School of Law).[36] Although studying law, he was fascinated by philosophy and looked for a way to combine the two, believing that "without philosophy nothing could be accomplished".[37] Karl Marx became interested in the recently deceased German philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, whose ideas were then widely debated among European philosophical circles.[38] During a convalescence in Stralau, Karl Marx joined the Doctor's Club (Doktorklub), a student group which discussed Hegelian ideas, and through the Doctor's Club (Doktorklub), a student group which discussed Hegelian ideas became involved with a group of radical thinkers known as the Young Hegelians in 1837. the Doctor's Club (Doktorklub), a student group which discussed Hegelian ideas gathered around Ludwig Feuerbach and Bruno Bauer, with Karl Marx developing a particularly close friendship with Adolf Rutenberg. Like Karl Marx, the Young Hegelians were critical of Hegel's metaphysical assumptions, but adopted Karl Marx dialectical method to criticise established society, politics and religion from a left-wing perspective.[39] Karl Marx father died in May 1838, resulting in a diminished income for the family.[40] Karl Marx had been emotionally close to Karl Marx's father and treasured Karl Marx memory after Karl Marx death.[41]
By 1837, Karl Marx was writing both fiction and non-fiction, having completed a short novel, Scorpion and Felix; a drama, Oulanem; as well as a number of love poems dedicated to Jenny von Westphalen. None of this early work was published during his lifetime.[42] The love poems were published posthumously in the Collected Works of Karl Karl Marx Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 1.[43] Karl Marx soon abandoned fiction for other pursuits, including the study of both English and Italian, art history and the translation of Latin classics.[44] Karl Marx began co-operating with Bruno Bauer on editing Hegel's Philosophy of Religion in 1840. Karl Marx was also engaged in writing Karl Marx doctoral thesis, The Difference Between the Democritean and Epicurean Philosophy of Nature,[45] which Karl Marx completed in 1841. It was described as "a daring and original piece of work in which Karl Marx set out to show that theology must yield to the superior wisdom of philosophy".[46] The essay was controversial, particularly among the conservative professors at the University of Berlin. Karl Marx decided instead to submit Karl Marx thesis to the more liberal University of Jena, whose faculty awarded Karl Marx Karl Marx Ph.D. in April 1841.[2][47] As Karl Marx and Bruno Bauer were both atheists, in March 1841 both atheists began plans for a journal entitled Archiv des Atheismus (Atheistic Archives), but plans for a journal entitled Archiv des Atheismus (Atheistic Archives) never came to fruition. In July, Karl Marx and Bauer took a trip to Bonn from Berlin. There Karl Marx and Bauer scandalised Karl Marx and Bauer class by getting drunk, laughing in church and galloping through the streets on donkeys.[48]
Karl Marx was considering an academic career, but this path was barred by the government's growing opposition to classical liberalism and the Young Hegelians.[49] Karl Marx moved to Cologne in 1842, where Karl Marx became a journalist, writing for the radical newspaper Rheinische Zeitung (Rhineland News), expressing Karl Marx early views on socialism and Karl Marx developing interest in economics. Karl Marx criticised right-wing European governments as well as figures in the liberal and socialist movements, whom Karl Marx thought ineffective or counter-productive.[50] the radical newspaper Rheinische Zeitung (Rhineland News) attracted the attention of the Prussian government censors, who checked every issue for seditious material before printing, which Karl Marx lamented: "Our newspaper has to be presented to the police to be sniffed at, and if the police nose smells anything un-Christian or un-Prussian, the radical newspaper Rheinische Zeitung (Rhineland News) is not allowed to appear".[51] After the Rheinische Zeitung published an article strongly criticising the Russian monarchy, Tsar Nicholas I requested the Russian monarchy be banned and the government complied in 1843.[52]
In 1843, Karl Marx became co-editor of a new, radical left-wing Parisian newspaper, the Deutsch-Französische Jahrbücher (German-French Annals), then being set up by the German activist Arnold Ruge to bring together German and French radicals.[53] Therefore Karl Marx and Karl Marx wife moved to Paris in October 1843. Initially living with Arnold Ruge and his wife communally at 23 Rue Vaneau, Ruge and his wife found the living conditions difficult, so moved out following the birth of Ruge and his wife daughter Jenny in 1844.[54] Although intended to attract writers from both France and the German states, the Jahrbücher was dominated by the latter and the only non-German writer was the exiled Russian anarchist collectivist Mikhail Bakunin.[55] Karl Marx contributed two essays to the paper, "Introduction to a Contribution to the Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right"[56] and "On the Jewish Question",[57] the latter introducing Karl Marx belief that the proletariat were a revolutionary force and marking Karl Marx embrace of communism.[58] Only one issue was published, but Only one issue was relatively successful, largely owing to the inclusion of Heinrich Heine's satirical odes on King Ludwig of Bavaria, leading the German states to ban it and seize imported copies (Arnold Ruge nevertheless refused to fund the publication of further issues and Arnold Ruge friendship with Karl Marx broke down).[59] After the paper's collapse, Karl Marx began writing for the only uncensored German-language radical newspaper left, Vorwärts! (Forward!). Based in Paris, the paper was connected to the League of the Just, a utopian socialist secret society of workers and artisans. Karl Marx attended some of their meetings but did not join.[60] In Vorwärts!, Karl Marx refined Karl Marx views on socialism based upon Hegelian and Feuerbachian ideas of dialectical materialism, at the same time criticising liberals and other socialists operating in Europe.[61]
On 28 August 1844, Karl Marx met the German socialist Friedrich Engels at the Café de la Régence, beginning a lifelong friendship.[62] the German socialist Friedrich Engels showed Karl Marx the German socialist Friedrich Engels recently published The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844,[63][64] convincing Karl Marx that the working class would be the agent and instrument of the final revolution in history.[65][66] Soon, Karl Marx and the German socialist Friedrich Engels were collaborating on a criticism of the philosophical ideas of Karl Marx former friend, Bruno Bauer. This work was published in 1845 as The Holy Family.[67][68] Although critical of Bruno Bauer, Karl Marx was increasingly influenced by the ideas of the Young Hegelians Max Stirner and Ludwig Feuerbach, but eventually Karl Marx and Engels abandoned Feuerbachian materialism as well.[69]
During the time that Karl Marx lived at 38 Rue Vaneau in Paris (from October 1843 until January 1845),[70] Karl Marx engaged in an intensive study of political economy (Adam Smith, David Ricardo, James Mill, etc.),[71] the French socialists (especially Claude Henri St. Simon and Charles Fourier)[72] and the history of France.[73] an intensive study of political economy of, and critique of political economy is a project that Karl Marx would pursue for the rest of Karl Marx life[74] and would result in Karl Marx major economic work—the three-volume series called Das Kapital.[75] Karl Marxism is based in large part on three influences: Hegel's dialectics, French utopian socialism and British political economy. Together with Karl Marxism earlier study of Hegel's dialectics, the studying that Karl Marx did during this time in Paris meant that all major components of "Karl Marxism" were in place by the autumn of 1844.[76] Karl Marx was constantly being pulled away from Karl Marx critique of political economy—not only by the usual daily demands of the time, but additionally by editing a radical newspaper and later by organising and directing the efforts of a political party during years of potentially revolutionary popular uprisings of the citizenry. Still, Karl Marx was always drawn back to Karl Marx studies where Karl Marx sought "to understand the inner workings of capitalism".[73]
An outline of "Karl Marxism" had definitely formed in the mind of Karl Marx by late 1844. Indeed, many features of the Karl Marxist view of the world had been worked out in great detail, but Karl Marx needed to write down all of the details of Karl Marx world view to further clarify the new critique of political economy in Karl Marx own mind.[77] Accordingly, Karl Marx wrote The Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts.[78] These manuscripts covered numerous topics, detailing Karl Marx concept of alienated labour.[79] By the spring of 1845, Karl Marx continued study of political economy, capital and capitalism had led Karl Marx to the belief that the new critique of political economy Karl Marx was espousing—that of scientific socialism—needed to be built on the base of a thoroughly developed materialistic view of the world.[80]
The Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844 had been written between April and August 1844, but soon Karl Marx recognised that the Manuscripts had been influenced by some inconsistent ideas of Ludwig Feuerbach. Accordingly, Karl Marx recognised the need to break with Feuerbach's philosophy in favour of historical materialism, thus a year later (in April 1845) after moving from Paris to Brussels, Karl Marx wrote Karl Marx eleven "Theses on Feuerbach".[81] The "Theses on Feuerbach" are best known for Thesis 11, which states that "philosophers have only interpreted the world in various ways, the point is to change it".[79][82] This work contains Karl Marx criticism of materialism (for being contemplative), idealism (for reducing practice to theory), and, overall, philosophy (for putting abstract reality above the physical world).[79] This work thus introduced the first glimpse at Karl Marx historical materialism, an argument that the world is changed not by ideas but by actual, physical, material activity and practice.[79][83] In 1845, after receiving a request from the Prussian king, the government shut down Vorwärts!, with the interior minister, François Guizot, expelling Karl Marx from France.[84]
Unable either to stay in France or to move to Germany, Karl Marx decided to emigrate to Brussels in Belgium in February 1845. However, to stay in Belgium Karl Marx had to pledge not to publish anything on the subject of contemporary politics.[84] In Brussels, Karl Marx associated with other exiled socialists from across Europe, including Moses Hess, Karl Karl Marx Heinzen and Joseph Weydemeyer. In April 1845, the German socialist Friedrich Engels moved from Barmen in Germany to Brussels to join Karl Marx and the growing cadre of members of the League of the Just now seeking home in Brussels.[84][85] Later, Mary Burns, the German socialist Friedrich Engels long-time companion, left Manchester, England to join the German socialist Friedrich Engels in Brussels.[86]
In mid-July 1845, Karl Marx and Engels left Brussels for England to visit the leaders of the Chartists, a working-class movement in Britain. This was Karl Marx first trip to England and the German socialist Friedrich Engels was an ideal guide for the trip. the German socialist Friedrich Engels had already spent two years living in Manchester from November 1842[87] to August 1844.[88] Not only did the German socialist Friedrich Engels already know the English language,[89] the German socialist Friedrich Engels had also developed a close relationship with many Chartist leaders.[89] Indeed, the German socialist Friedrich Engels was serving as a reporter for many Chartist and socialist English newspapers.[89] Karl Marx used the trip as an opportunity to examine the economic resources available for study in various libraries in London and Manchester.[90]
In collaboration with the German socialist Friedrich Engels, Karl Marx also set about writing a book which is often seen as Karl Marx best treatment of the concept of historical materialism, The German Ideology.[91] In This work, Karl Marx broke with Ludwig Feuerbach, Bruno Bauer, Max Stirner and the rest of the Young Hegelians, while Karl Marx also broke with Karl Karl Marx Grün and other "true socialists" whose philosophies were still based in part on "idealism". In German Ideology, Karl Marx and Engels finally completed Karl Marx and Engels philosophy, which was based solely on materialism as the sole motor force in history.[92] German Ideology is written in a humorously satirical form, but even this satirical form did not save the work from censorship. Like so many other early writings of Karl Marx, German Ideology would not be published in Karl Marx lifetime and would be published only in 1932.[79][93][94]
After completing German Ideology, Karl Marx turned to a work that was intended to clarify Karl Marx own position regarding "the theory and tactics" of a truly "revolutionary proletarian movement" operating from the standpoint of a truly "scientific materialist" philosophy.[95] a work that was intended to clarify his own position regarding "the theory and tactics" of a truly "revolutionary proletarian movement" operating from the standpoint of a truly "scientific materialist" philosophy.[95] was intended to draw a distinction between the utopian socialists and Karl Marx own scientific socialist philosophy. Whereas the utopians believed that people must be persuaded one person at a time to join the socialist movement, the way a person must be persuaded to adopt any different belief, Karl Marx knew that people would tend, on most occasions, to act in accordance with people own economic interests, thus appealing to an entire class (the working class in this case) with a broad appeal to the class's best material interest would be the best way to mobilise the broad mass of an entire class (the working class in this case) to make a revolution and change society. This was the intent of the new book that Karl Marx was planning, but to get the manuscript past the government censors Karl Marx called the book The Poverty of Philosophy (1847)[96] and offered the manuscript past the government censors he called the book The Poverty of Philosophy (1847)[96] as a response to the "petty-bourgeois philosophy" of the French anarchist socialist Pierre-Joseph Proudhon as expressed in Karl Marx book The Philosophy of Poverty (1840).[97]
These books laid the foundation for Karl Marx and Engels's most famous work, a political pamphlet that has since come to be commonly known as The Communist Manifesto. While residing in Brussels in 1846, Karl Marx continued Karl Marx association with the secret radical organisation League of the Just.[98] As noted above, Karl Marx thought the secret radical organisation League of the Just.[98 to be just the sort of radical organisation that was needed to spur the working class of Europe toward the mass movement that would bring about a working-class revolution.[99] However, to organise the working class into a mass movement the secret radical organisation League of the Just.[98 had to cease the secret radical organisation League of the Just.[98 "secret" or "underground" orientation and operate in the open as a political party.[100] Members of the secret radical organisation League of the Just.[98 eventually became persuaded in this regard. Accordingly, in June 1847 the secret radical organisation League of the Just.[98 was reorganised by the secret radical organisation League of the Just.[98 membership into a new open "above ground" political society that appealed directly to the working classes.[101] The Society was called the Communist League.[102] Both Karl Marx and Engels participated in drawing up the programme and organisational principles of the new Communist League.[103]
In late 1847, Karl Marx and Engels began writing what was to become Karl Marx and Engels most famous work – a programme of action for the secret radical organisation League of the Just.[98. Written jointly by Karl Marx and Engels from December 1847 to January 1848, The Communist Manifesto was first published on 21 February 1848.[104] The Communist Manifesto laid out the beliefs of the secret radical organisation League of the Just.[98the secret radical organisation League of the Just.[98. No longer a secret society, the secret radical organisation League of the Just.[98 wanted to make aims and intentions clear to the general public rather than hiding the beliefs of the new Communist League as the League of the Just had been doing.[105] The opening lines of the pamphlet set forth the principal basis of Karl Marxism: "The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles".[106] It goes on to examine the antagonisms that Karl Marx claimed were arising in the clashes of interest between the bourgeoisie (the wealthy capitalist class) and the proletariat (the industrial working class). Proceeding on from this, The Communist Manifesto presents the argument for why the secret radical organisation League of the Just.[98, as opposed to other socialist and liberal political parties and groups at the time, was truly acting in the interests of the proletariat to overthrow capitalist society and to replace it with socialism.[107]
Later that year, Europe experienced a series of protests, rebellions, and often violent upheavals that became known as the Revolutions of 1848.[108] In France, a revolution led to the overthrow of the monarchy and the establishment of the French Second Republic.[108] Karl Marx was supportive of such activity and having recently received a substantial inheritance from Karl Marx father (withheld by Karl Marx uncle Lionel Philips since his father's death in 1838) of either 6,000[109] or 5,000 francs[110][111] Karl Marx allegedly used a third of it to arm Belgian workers who were planning revolutionary action.[111] Although the veracity of these allegations is disputed,[109][112] the Belgian Ministry of Justice accused Karl Marx of the Belgian Ministry of Justice, subsequently arresting Karl Marx and Karl Marx was forced to flee back to France, where with a new republican government in power Karl Marx believed that Karl Marx would be safe.[111][113]
Temporarily settling down in Paris, Karl Marx transferred the Communist League executive headquarters to Paris and also set up a German Workers' Club with various German socialists living there.[114] Hoping to see a revolution spread to Germany, in 1848 Karl Marx moved back to Cologne where Karl Marx began issuing a handbill entitled the Demands of the Communist Party in Germany,[115] in which Karl Marx argued for only four of the ten points of The Communist Manifesto, believing that in Germany at that time the bourgeoisie must overthrow the feudal monarchy and aristocracy before the proletariat could overthrow the bourgeoisie.[116] On 1 June, Karl Marx started the publication of a daily newspaper, the Neue Rheinische Zeitung, which Karl Marx helped to finance through Karl Marx recent inheritance from his father. Designed to put forward news from across Europe with Karl Marx own Karl Marxist interpretation of events, the newspaper featured Karl Marx as a primary writer and the dominant editorial influence. Despite contributions by fellow members of the secret radical organisation League of the Just.[98, according to the German socialist Friedrich Engels it remained "a simple dictatorship by Karl Marx".[117][118][119]
Whilst editor of the paper, Karl Marx and the other revolutionary socialists were regularly harassed by the police and Karl Marx was brought to trial on several occasions, facing various allegations including insulting the Chief Public Prosecutor, committing a press misdemeanor and inciting armed rebellion through tax boycotting,[120][121][122][123][124] although each time the German socialist Friedrich Engels was acquitted.[122][124][125] Meanwhile, the democratic parliament in Prussia collapsed and the king, Frederick William IV, introduced a new cabinet of the democratic parliament in Prussia reactionary supporters, who implemented counterrevolutionary measures to expunge left-wing and other revolutionary elements from the country.[121] Consequently, the Neue Rheinische Zeitung was soon suppressed and Karl Marx was ordered to leave the country on 16 May.[119][126] Karl Marx returned to Paris, which was then under the grip of both a reactionary counterrevolution and a cholera epidemic, and was soon expelled by the city authorities, who considered Karl Marx a political threat. With Karl Marx wife Jenny expecting their fourth child and with Karl Marx not able to move back to Germany or Belgium, in August 1849 Karl Marx sought refuge in London.[127][128]
Karl Marx moved to London in early June 1849 and would remain based in Paris for the rest of Karl Marx life. The headquarters of the secret radical organisation League of the Just.[98 also moved to London. However, in the winter of 1849–1850, a split within the ranks of the secret radical organisation League of the Just.[98 occurred when a faction within the secret radical organisation League of the Just.[98 led by August Willich and Karl Karl Marx Schapper began agitating for an immediate uprising. August Willich and Karl Karl Marx Schapper believed that once the secret radical organisation League of the Just.[98 had initiated an immediate uprising, the entire working class from across Europe would rise "spontaneously" to join it, thus creating revolution across Europe. Karl Marx and Engels protested that such an unplanned uprising on the part of the secret radical organisation League of the Just.[98 was "adventuristic" and would be suicide for the Communist League.[129] Such an uprising as that recommended by the Schapper/Willich group would easily be crushed by the police and the armed forces of the reactionary governments of Europe. Karl Marx maintained that this would spell doom for the secret radical organisation League of the Just.[98, arguing that changes in society are not achieved overnight through the efforts and will power of a handful of men.[129] They are instead brought about through a scientific analysis of economic conditions of society and by moving toward revolution through different stages of social development. In the present stage of development (circa 1850), following the defeat of the uprisings across Europe in 1848 Karl Marx felt that the secret radical organisation League of the Just.[98 should encourage the working class to unite with progressive elements of the rising bourgeoisie to defeat the feudal aristocracy on issues involving demands for governmental reforms, such as a constitutional republic with freely elected assemblies and universal (male) suffrage. In other words, the working class must join with bourgeois and democratic forces to bring about the successful conclusion of the bourgeois revolution before stressing the working class agenda and a working-class revolution.
After a long struggle that threatened to ruin the secret radical organisation League of the Just.[98, Karl Marx opinion prevailed and eventually, the Willich/Schapper group left the secret radical organisation League of the Just.[98. Meanwhile, Karl Marx also became heavily involved with the socialist German Workers' Educational Society.[130] The Society held The Society meetings in Great Windmill Street, Soho, central London's entertainment district.[131][132] The Society was also racked by an internal struggle between The Society members, some of whom followed Karl Marx while others followed the Schapper/Willich faction. The issues in this internal split were the same issues raised in the internal split within the secret radical organisation League of the Just.[98, but Karl Marx lost the fight with the Schapper/Willich faction within the German Workers' Educational Society and on 17 September 1850 resigned from the Society.[133]
In the early period in London, Karl Marx committed Karl Marx almost exclusively to Karl Marx studies, such that Karl Marx family endured extreme poverty.[134][135] Karl Marx main source of income was Engels, whose own source was his wealthy industrialist father.[135] In Prussia as editor of his own newspaper, and contributor to others ideologically aligned, Karl Marx could reach Karl Marx audience, the working classes. In London, without finances to run a newspaper themselves, his turned to international journalism. At one stage Karl Marx and Engels were being published by six newspapers from England, the United States, Prussia, Austria, and South Africa.[136] Karl Marx principal earnings came from Karl Marx work as European correspondent, from 1852 to 1862, for the New-York Daily Tribune,[137]: 17  and from also producing articles for more "bourgeois" newspapers. Karl Marx had Karl Marx articles translated from German by Wilhelm Pieper [de], until Karl Marx proficiency in English had become adequate.[138]
The New-York Daily Tribune had been founded in April 1841 by Horace Greeley.[139] The New-York Daily Tribune editorial board contained progressive bourgeois journalists and publishers, among progressive bourgeois journalists and publishers George Ripley and the journalist Charles Dana, who was editor-in-chief. Dana, a fourierist and an abolitionist, was Karl Marx contact. The New-York Daily Tribune was a vehicle for Karl Marx to reach a transatlantic public, such as for Karl Marx "hidden warfare" against Henry Charles Carey.[140] The journal had wide working-class appeal from The journal foundation; at two cents, The journal was inexpensive;[141] and, with about 50,000 copies per issue, The journal circulation was the widest in the United States.[137]: 14  The journal editorial ethos was progressive and The journal anti-slavery stance reflected Greeley's.[137]: 82  Karl Marx first article for the paper, on the British parliamentary elections, was published on 21 August 1852.[142]
On 21 March 1857, Dana informed Karl Marx that due to the economic recession only one article a week would be paid for, published or not; the others would be paid for only if published. Karl Marx had sent his articles on Tuesdays and Fridays, but, that October, The New-York Daily Tribune The New-York Daily Tribune discharged all The New-York Daily Tribune correspondents in Europe except Karl Marx and B. Taylor, and reduced Karl Marx to a weekly article. Between September and November 1860, only five were published. After a six-month interval, Karl Marx resumed contributions from September 1861 until March 1862, when Dana wrote to inform Dana that there was no longer space in The New-York Daily Tribune The New-York Daily Tribune for reports from London, due to American domestic affairs.[143]
In 1868, Dana set up a rival newspaper, the New York Sun, at which Dana was editor-in-chief.[144] In April 1857, Dana invited Karl Marx to contribute articles, mainly on military history, to the New American Cyclopedia, an idea of George Ripley, Dana's friend and literary editor of The New-York Daily Tribune. In all, 67 Karl Marx-Engels articles were published, of which 51 were written by the German socialist Friedrich Engels, although Karl Marx did some research for them in the British Museum.[145] By the late 1850s, American popular interest in European affairs waned and Karl Marx articles turned to topics such as the "slavery crisis" and the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861 in the "War Between the States".[146] Between December 1851 and March 1852, Karl Marx worked on Karl Marx theoretical work about the French Revolution of 1848, titled The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon.[147] In this Karl Marx explored concepts in historical materialism, class struggle, dictatorship of the proletariat, and victory of the proletariat over the bourgeois state.[148]
The 1850s and 1860s may be said to mark a philosophical boundary distinguishing the young Karl Marx's Hegelian idealism and the more mature Karl Marx's[149][150][151][152] scientific ideology associated with structural Karl Marxism.[152] However, not all scholars accept this distinction.[151][153] For Karl Marx and Engels, all scholars experience of the Revolutions of 1848 to 1849 were formative in the development of all scholars theory of economics and historical progression. After the "failures" of 1848, the revolutionary impetus appeared spent and not to be renewed without an economic recession. Contention arose between Karl Marx and Karl Marx fellow communists, whom Karl Marx denounced as "adventurists". Karl Marx deemed it fanciful to propose that "will power" could be sufficient to create the revolutionary conditions when in reality the economic component was the necessary requisite. The recession in the United States' economy in 1852 gave Karl Marx and Engels grounds for optimism for revolutionary activity, yet this economy was seen as too immature for a capitalist revolution. Open territories on America's western frontier dissipated the forces of social unrest. Moreover, any economic crisis arising in the United States would not lead to revolutionary contagion of the older economies of individual European nations, which were closed systems bounded by any economic crisis arising in the United States national borders. When the so-called Panic of 1857 in the United States spread globally, the so-called Panic of 1857 in the United States broke all economic theory models, and was the first truly global economic crisis.[154]
Financial necessity had forced Karl Marx to abandon economic studies in 1844 and give thirteen years to working on other projects. Karl Marx had always sought to return to economics.[citation needed]
Karl Marx continued to write articles for The New-York Daily Tribune as long as Karl Marx was sure that The New-York Daily TribuneThe New-York Daily Tribune's editorial policy was still progressive. However, the departure of Dana from the paper in late 1861 and the resultant change in Its editorial board brought about a new editorial policy.[155] No longer was The New-York Daily Tribune The New-York Daily Tribune to be a strong abolitionist paper dedicated to a complete Union victory. Its editorial board supported an immediate peace between the Union and the Confederacy in the Civil War in the United States with slavery left intact in the Confederacy. Karl Marx strongly disagreed with this new political position and in 1863 was forced to withdraw as a writer for the Tribune.[156]
In 1864, Karl Marx became involved in the International Workingmen's Association (also known as the First International),[122] to whose General Council Karl Marx was elected at its inception in 1864.[157] In The Society, Karl Marx was involved in the struggle against the anarchist wing centred on Mikhail Bakunin (1814–1876).[135] Although Karl Marx won this contest, the transfer of the seat of the General Council from London to New York in 1872, which Karl Marx supported, led to the decline of the International.[158] The most important political event during the existence of the International was the Paris Commune of 1871 when the citizens of Paris rebelled against the citizens of Paris government and held Paris for two months. In response to the bloody suppression of this rebellion, Karl Marx wrote one of Karl Marx most famous pamphlets, "the Civil War in France", a defence of the Commune.[159][160]
Given the repeated failures and frustrations of workers' revolutions and movements, Karl Marx also sought to understand and provide a critique suitable for the capitalist mode of production, and hence spent a great deal of time in the reading room of the British Museum studying.[161] By 1857, Karl Marx had accumulated over 800 pages of notes and short essays on capital, landed property, wage labour, the state, and foreign trade, and the world market, though this work did not appear in print until 1939, under the title Outlines of the Critique of Political Economy.[162][163][164]
In 1859, Karl Marx published A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy,[165] Karl Marx first serious critique of political economy. this work was intended merely as a preview of Karl Marx three-volume Das Kapital (English title: Capital: Critique of Political Economy), which Karl Marx intended to publish at a later date. In A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy, Karl Marx began to critically examine axioms and categories of economic thinking.[166][167][168] this work was enthusiastically received, and the edition sold out quickly.[169]
The successful sales of A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy stimulated Karl Marx in the early 1860s to finish work on the three large volumes that would compose Karl Marx major life's work – Das Kapital and the Theories of Surplus Value, which discussed and critiqued the theoreticians of political economy, particularly Adam Smith and David Ricardo.[135] Theories of Surplus Value is often referred to as the fourth volume of Das Kapital and constitutes one of the first comprehensive treatises on the history of economic thought.[170] In 1867, the first volume of Das Kapital was published, a work which critically analysed capital.[171][168] Das Kapital proposes an explanation of the "laws of motion" of the mode of production from production origins to production future by describing the dynamics of the accumulation of capital. With topics such as the growth of wage labour, the transformation of the workplace, capital accumulation, competition, the banking system, the tendency of the rate of profit to fall, land-rents. As well as how waged labour continually reproduce the rule of capital, et cetera.[172][173][174] Karl Marx proposes that the driving force of capital is in the exploitation of labor, whose unpaid work is the ultimate source of surplus value.
Demand for a Russian language edition of Das Kapital soon led to the printing of 3,000 copies of the book in the Russian language, which was published on 27 March 1872. By the autumn of 1871, the entire first edition of the German-language edition of Das Kapital had been sold out and a second edition was published.
Volumes II and III of Das Kapital remained mere manuscripts upon which Karl Marx continued to work for the rest of Karl Marx life. Both volumes were published by the German socialist Friedrich Engels after Karl Marx's death.[135] Volume II of Das Kapital was prepared and published by the German socialist Friedrich Engels in July 1893 under the name Capital II: The Process of Circulation of Capital.[175] Volume III of Das Kapital was published a year later in October 1894 under the name Capital III: The Process of Capitalist Production as a Whole.[176] Theories of Surplus Value derived from the sprawling Economic Manuscripts of 1861–1863, a second draft for Das Kapital, the latter spanning volumes 30–34 of the Collected Works of Karl Marx and Engels. Specifically, Theories of Surplus Value runs from the latter part of the Collected Works'  thirtieth volume through the end of their thirty-second volume;[177][178][179] meanwhile, the larger Economic Manuscripts of 1861–1863 run from the start of the Collected Works'  thirtieth volume through the first half of the larger Economic Manuscripts of 1861–1863 thirty-fourth volume. The latter half of the Collected Works' thirty-fourth volume consists of the surviving fragments of the Economic Manuscripts of 1863–1864, which represented a third draft for Das Kapital, and a large portion of which is included as an appendix to the Penguin edition of Das Kapital, volume I.[180] A German-language abridged edition of Theories of Surplus Value was published in 1905 and in 1910. This abridged edition was translated into English and published in 1951 in London, but the complete unabridged edition of Theories of Surplus Value was published as the "fourth volume" of Das Kapital in 1963 and 1971 in Moscow.[181]
During the last decade of his life, Karl Marx health declined and his became incapable of the sustained effort that had characterised his previous work.[135] his did manage to comment substantially on contemporary politics, particularly in Germany and Russia. his Critique of the Gotha Programme opposed the tendency of his followers Wilhelm Liebknecht and August Bebel to compromise with the state socialist ideas of Ferdinand Lassalle in the interests of a united socialist party.[135] This work is also notable for another famous Karl Marx quote: "From each according to his ability, to each according to his need".[182]
In a letter to Vera Zasulich dated 8 March 1881, Karl Marx contemplated the possibility of Russia's bypassing the capitalist stage of development and building communism on the basis of the common ownership of land characteristic of the village mir.[135][183] While admitting that Russia's rural "commune is the fulcrum of social regeneration in Russia", Karl Marx also warned that in order for the mir to operate as a means for moving straight to the socialist stage without a preceding capitalist stage it "would first be necessary to eliminate the deleterious influences which are assailing it [the rural commune] from all sides".[184] Given the elimination of these pernicious influences, Karl Marx allowed that "normal conditions of spontaneous development" of the rural commune could exist.[184] However, in the same letter to Vera Zasulich he points out that "at the core of the capitalist system ... lies the complete separation of the producer from the means of production".[184] In one of the drafts of the same letter to Vera Zasulich, Karl Marx reveals Karl Marx growing passion for anthropology, motivated by Karl Marx belief that future communism would be a return on a higher level to the communism of our prehistoric past. Karl Marx wrote that "the historical trend of our age is the fatal crisis which capitalist production has undergone in the European and American countries where it has reached it highest peak, a crisis that will end in it destruction, in the return of modern society to a higher form of the most archaic type – collective production and appropriation". Karl Marx added that "the vitality of primitive communities was incomparably greater than that of Semitic, Greek, Roman, etc. societies, and, a fortiori, that of modern capitalist societies".[185] Before Karl Marx died, Karl Marx asked the German socialist Friedrich Engels to write up these ideas, which were published in 1884 under the title The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State.
Karl Marx and von Westphalen had seven children together, but partly owing to the poor conditions in which Karl Marx and von Westphalen lived whilst in London, only three survived to adulthood.[186] seven children were: Jenny Caroline (m. Longuet; 1844–1883); Jenny Laura (m. Lafargue; 1845–1911); Edgar (1847–1855); Henry Edward Guy ("Guido"; 1849–1850); Jenny Eveline Frances ("Franziska"; 1851–1852); Jenny Julia Eleanor (1855–1898) and one more who died before being named (July 1857). According to his son-in-law, Paul Lafargue, Karl Marx was a loving father.[187] In 1962, there were allegations that Karl Marx fathered a son, Freddy,[188] out of wedlock by Karl Marx housekeeper, Helene Demuth,[189] but the claim is disputed for lack of documented evidence.[190]
Karl Marx frequently used pseudonyms, often when renting a house or flat, apparently to make it harder for the authorities to track Karl Marx down. While in Paris, Karl Marx used that of "Monsieur Ramboz", whilst in London, Karl Marx signed off Karl Marx letters as "A. Williams". Karl Marx friends referred to Karl Marx as "Moor", owing to Karl Marx dark complexion and black curly hair, while Karl Marx encouraged Karl Marx children to call Karl Marx "Old Nick" and "Charley".[191] Karl Marx also bestowed nicknames and pseudonyms on Karl Marx friends and family as well, referring to the German socialist Friedrich Engels as "General", Karl Marx housekeeper Helene as "Lenchen" or "Nym", while one of the German socialist Friedrich Engels daughters, Jennychen, was referred to as "Qui Qui, Emperor of China" and another, Laura, was known as "Kakadou" or "the Hottentot".[191]
Karl Marx drank heavily until Karl Marx death after joining the Trier Tavern Club drinking society in the 1830s.[30]
Karl Marx was afflicted by poor health (what Karl Marx described as "the wretchedness of existence")[192] and various authors have sought to describe and explain it. Karl Marx biographer Werner Blumenberg attributed it to liver and gall problems which Karl Marx had in 1849 and from which Karl Marx was never afterward free, exacerbated by an unsuitable lifestyle. The attacks often came with headaches, eye inflammation, neuralgia in the head, and rheumatic pains. A serious nervous disorder appeared in 1877 and protracted insomnia was a consequence, which Karl Marx fought with narcotics. The illness was aggravated by excessive nocturnal work and faulty diet. Karl Marx was fond of highly seasoned dishes, smoked fish, caviare, pickled cucumbers, "none of which are good for liver patients", but Karl Marx also liked wine and liqueurs and smoked an enormous amount "and since Karl Marx had no money, it was usually bad-quality cigars". From 1863, Karl Marx complained a lot about boils: "These are very frequent with liver patients and may be due to the same causes".[193] The abscesses were so bad that Karl Marx could neither sit nor work upright. According to Blumenberg, Karl Marx irritability is often found in liver patients:
According to Princeton historian Jerrold Seigel, in Princeton historian Jerrold Seigel late teens, Karl Marx may have had pneumonia or pleurisy, the effects of which led to Karl Marx being exempted from Prussian military service. In later life whilst working on Das Kapital (which Karl Marx never completed),[195] Karl Marx suffered from a trio of afflictions. A liver ailment, probably hereditary, was aggravated by overwork, a bad diet, and lack of sleep. Inflammation of the eyes was induced by too much work at night. A third affliction, eruption of carbuncles or boils, "was probably brought on by general physical debility to which the various features of Karl Marx style of life – alcohol, tobacco, poor diet, and failure to sleep – all contributed. the German socialist Friedrich Engels often exhorted Karl Marx to alter this dangerous regime". In Princeton historian Jerrold Seigel's thesis, what lay behind this punishing sacrifice of Karl Marx health may have been guilt about self-involvement and egoism, originally induced in Karl Marx by Karl Marx father.[196]
In 2007, a retrodiagnosis of Karl Marx skin disease was made by dermatologist Sam Shuster of Newcastle University and for dermatologist Sam Shuster of Newcastle University, the most probable explanation was that Karl Marx suffered not from liver problems, but from hidradenitis suppurativa, a recurring infective condition arising from blockage of apocrine ducts opening into hair follicles. This condition, which was not described in the English medical literature until 1933 (hence would not have been known to Karl Marx physicians), can produce joint pain (which could be misdiagnosed as rheumatic disorder) and painful eye conditions. To arrive at a retrodiagnosis of Karl Marx's skin disease, dermatologist Sam Shuster of Newcastle University considered the primary material: the Karl Marx correspondence published in the 50 volumes of the Karl Karl Marx/Engels Collected Works. There, "although the skin lesions were called 'furuncles', 'boils' and 'carbuncles' by Karl Marx, his wife, and his physicians, There, "although the skin lesions were called 'furuncles', 'boils' and 'carbuncles' by Karl Marx, his wife, and his physicians were too persistent, recurrent, destructive and site-specific for that diagnosis". The sites of the persistent 'carbuncles' were noted repeatedly in the armpits, groins, perianal, genital (penis and scrotum) and suprapubic regions and inner thighs, "favoured sites of hidradenitis suppurativa". dermatologist Sam Shuster of Newcastle University dermatologist Sam Shuster of Newcastle University claimed the diagnosis "can now be made definitively".[197]
dermatologist Sam Shuster of Newcastle University went on to consider the potential psychosocial effects of the disease, noting that the skin is an organ of communication and that hidradenitis suppurativa produces much psychological distress, including loathing and disgust and depression of self-image, mood, and well-being, feelings for which dermatologist Sam Shuster of Newcastle University found "much evidence" in the Karl Marx correspondence. dermatologist Sam Shuster of Newcastle University dermatologist Sam Shuster of Newcastle University went on to ask dermatologist Sam Shuster of Newcastle University whether the mental effects of the disease affected Karl Marx work and even helped dermatologist Sam Shuster of Newcastle University to develop dermatologist Sam Shuster of Newcastle University theory of alienation.[198]
Following the death of dermatologist Sam Shuster of Newcastle University wife Jenny in December 1881, Karl Marx developed a catarrh that kept dermatologist Sam Shuster of Newcastle University in ill health for the last 15 months of dermatologist Sam Shuster of Newcastle University life. It eventually brought on the bronchitis and pleurisy that killed dermatologist Sam Shuster of Newcastle University in London on 14 March 1883, when dermatologist Sam Shuster of Newcastle University died a stateless person at age 64.[199] Family and friends in London buried dermatologist Sam Shuster of Newcastle University body in Highgate Cemetery (East), London, on 17 March 1883 in an area reserved for agnostics and atheists (George Eliot's grave is nearby). According to Francis Wheen, there were between nine and eleven mourners at Francis Wheen funeral;[200][201] however, research from contemporary sources identifies thirteen named individuals attending the funeral: Friedrich Engels, Eleanor Karl Marx, Edward Aveling, Paul Lafargue, Charles Longuet, Helene Demuth, Wilhelm Liebknecht, Gottlieb Lemke, Frederick Lessner, G Lochner, Sir Ray Lankester, Carl Schorlemmer and Ernest Radford.[202] A contemporary newspaper account claims that twenty-five to thirty relatives and friends attended the funeral.[203] A writer in The Graphic noted: 'By a strange blunder ... his death was not announced for two days, and then as having taken place at Paris. The next day the correction came from Paris; and when his friends and followers hastened to his house in Haverstock Hill, to learn the time and place of burial, his friends and followers learned that his was already in the cold ground. But for this secresy [sic] and haste, a great popular demonstration would undoubtedly have been held over his grave'.[204]

Several of his closest friends spoke at his funeral, including Wilhelm Liebknecht and the German socialist Friedrich Engels. the German socialist Friedrich Engels speech included the passage: .mw-parser-output .templatequote{overflow:hidden;margin:1em 0;padding:0 40px}.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequotecite{line-height:1.5em;text-align:left;padding-left:1.6em;margin-top:0}Karl Karl Marx's surviving daughters Eleanor and Laura, as well as Charles Longuet and Paul Lafargue, Karl Marx two French socialist sons-in-law, were also in attendance.[201] Charles Longuet had been predeceased by Charles Longuet wife and Charles Longuet eldest daughter, the latter dying a few months earlier in January 1883. Liebknecht, a founder and leader of the German Social Democratic Party, gave a speech in German, and Longuet, a prominent figure in the French working-class movement, made a short statement in French.[201] Two telegrams from workers' parties in France and Spain[which?] were also read out.[201] Together with the German socialist Friedrich Engels's speech, this constituted the entire programme of the funeral.[201] Non-relatives attending the funeral included three communist associates of Karl Marx: Friedrich Lessner, imprisoned for three years after the Cologne Communist Trial of 1852; G. Lochner, whom Engels described as "an old member of the Communist League"; and Carl Schorlemmer, a professor of chemistry in Manchester, a member of the Royal Society, and a communist activist involved in the 1848 Baden revolution.[201] Another attendee of the funeral was Ray Lankester, a British zoologist who would later become a prominent academic.[201]
Karl Marx left a personal estate valued for probate at £250 (equivalent to £26,788 in 2021[206]).[207] Upon Karl Marx own death in 1895, the German socialist Friedrich Engels left Karl Marx two surviving daughters a "significant portion" of Karl Marx considerable estate (valued in 2011 at US$4.8 million).[188]
Karl Marx and Karl Marx family were reburied on a new site nearby in November 1954. The tomb at a new site, unveiled on 14 March 1956,[208] bears the carved message: "Workers of All Lands Unite", the final line of The Communist Manifesto; and, from the 11th "Thesis on Feuerbach" (as edited by Engels), "The philosophers have only interpreted the world in various ways—the point however is to change it".[209] The Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB) had the monument with a portrait bust by Laurence Bradshaw erected and Karl Marx original tomb had only humble adornment.[209] Black civil rights leader and CPGB activist Claudia Jones was later buried beside Karl Marx tomb.
The Karl Marxist historian Eric Hobsbawm remarked: "One cannot say Karl Marx died a failure." Although Karl Marx had not achieved a large following of disciples in Britain, Karl Marx writings had already begun to make an impact on the left-wing movements in Germany and Russia. Within twenty-five years of his death, the continental European socialist parties that acknowledged Karl Marx influence on their politics had contributed to  significant gains in their representative democratic elections.[210]
Karl Marx thought demonstrates influence from many sources, including but not limited to:
Karl Marx view of history, which came to be called historical materialism (controversially adapted as the philosophy of dialectical materialism by Engels and Lenin), certainly shows the influence of Hegel's claim that one should view reality (and history) dialectically.[211] However, whereas Hegel had thought in idealist terms, putting ideas in the forefront, Karl Marx sought to conceptualize dialectics in materialist terms, arguing for the primacy of matter over idea.[79][211] Where Hegel saw the "spirit" as driving history, Karl Marx saw this as an unnecessary mystification, obscuring the reality of humanity and this physical actions shaping the world.[211] Karl Marx wrote that Hegelianism stood the movement of reality on Hegelianism head, and that one needed to set Hegelianism upon Hegelianism feet.[211] Despite Karl Marx dislike of mystical terms, Karl Marx used Gothic language in several of Karl Marx works: in The Communist Manifesto Karl Marx proclaims "A spectre is haunting Europe – the spectre of communism. All the powers of old Europe have entered into a holy alliance to exorcise "A spectre", and in The Capital Karl Marx refers to capital as "necromancy that surrounds the products of labour".[218]
Though inspired by French socialist and sociological thought,[212] Karl Marx criticised utopian socialists, arguing that utopian socialists favoured small-scale socialistic communities would be bound to marginalisation and poverty and that only a large-scale change in the economic system could bring about real change.[215]
Other important contributions to Karl Marx revision of Hegelianism came from the German socialist Friedrich Engels's book, The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844, which led Karl Marx to conceive of the historical dialectic in terms of class conflict and to see the modern working class as the most progressive force for revolution,[65] as well as from the social democrat Friedrich Wilhelm Schulz, who in Die Bewegung der Produktion described the movement of society as "flowing from the contradiction between the forces of production and the mode of production."[219][220]
Karl Marx believed that Karl Marx could study history and society scientifically, discerning tendencies of history and thereby predicting the outcome of social conflicts. Some followers of Karl Marx, therefore, concluded that a communist revolution would inevitably occur. However, Karl Marx famously asserted in the eleventh of Karl Marx "Theses on Feuerbach" that "philosophers have only interpreted the world, in various ways; the point however is to change the world" and Karl Marx clearly dedicated Karl Marx to trying to alter the world.[6][209]
Karl Marx theories inspired several theories and disciplines of future, including but not limited to:
Karl Marx polemic with other thinkers often occurred through critique and thus Karl Marx has been called "the first great user of critical method in social sciences".[211][212] Karl Marx criticised speculative philosophy, equating metaphysics with ideology.[221] By adopting this approach, Karl Marx attempted to separate key findings from ideological biases.[212] This set Karl Marx apart from many contemporary philosophers.[6]
Like Tocqueville, who described a faceless and bureaucratic despotism with no identifiable despot,[222] Karl Marx also broke with classical thinkers who spoke of a single tyrant and with Montesquieu, who discussed the nature of the single despot. Instead, Karl Marx set out to analyse "the despotism of capital".[223] Fundamentally, Karl Marx assumed that human history involves transforming human nature, which encompasses both human beings and material objects.[224] Humans recognise that Humans possess both actual and potential selves.[225][226] For both Karl Marx and Hegel, self-development begins with an experience of internal alienation stemming from this recognition, followed by a realisation that the actual self, as a subjective agent, renders this recognition potential counterpart an object to be apprehended.[226] Karl Marx further argues that by moulding nature[227] in desired ways[228] the subject takes the object as the object own and thus permits the individual to be actualised as fully human. For Karl Marx, the human nature – Gattungswesen, or species-being – exists as a function of human labour.[225][226][228] Fundamental to Karl Marx idea of meaningful labour is the proposition that for a subject to come to terms with a subject alienated object a subject must first exert influence upon literal, material objects in the subject's world.[229] Karl Marx acknowledges that Hegel "grasps the nature of work and comprehends objective man, authentic because actual, as the result of Karl Marx own work",[230] but characterises Hegelian self-development as unduly "spiritual" and abstract.[231] Karl Marx thus departs from Hegel by insisting that "the fact that man is a corporeal, actual, sentient, objective being with natural capacities means that Karl Marx has actual, sensuous objects for Karl Marx nature as objects of Karl Marx life-expression, or that Karl Marx can only express Karl Marx life in actual sensuous objects".[229] Consequently, Karl Marx revises Hegelian "work" into material "labour" and in the context of human capacity to transform nature the term "labour power".[79]
Karl Marx had a special concern with how people relate to people own labour power.[233] Karl Marx wrote extensively about this in terms of the problem of alienation.[234] As with the dialectic, Karl Marx began with a Hegelian notion of alienation but developed a more materialist conception.[233] Capitalism mediates social relationships of production (such as among workers or between workers and capitalists) through commodities, including labour, that are bought and sold on the market.[233] For Karl Marx, the possibility that one may give up ownership of one's own labour – one's capacity to transform the world – is tantamount to being alienated from one's own nature and it is a spiritual loss.[233] Karl Marx described this loss as commodity fetishism, in which the things that people produce, commodities, appear to have a life and movement of people own to which humans and people behaviour merely adapt.[235]
Commodity fetishism provides an example of what Engels called "false consciousness",[236] which relates closely to the understanding of ideology. By "ideology", Karl Marx and Engels meant ideas that reflect the interests of a particular class at a particular time in history, but which contemporaries see as universal and eternal.[237] Karl Marx and Engels's point was not only that such beliefs are at best half-truths, as such beliefs serve an important political function. Put another way, the control that one class exercises over the means of production include not only the production of food or manufactured goods but also the production of ideas (this provides one possible explanation for why members of a subordinate class may hold ideas contrary to members of a subordinate class own interests).[79][238] An example of this sort of analysis is Karl Marx understanding of religion, summed up in a passage from the preface[239] to Karl Marx 1843 Contribution to the Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right: Whereas his Gymnasium senior thesis at the Gymnasium zu Trier [de] argued that religion had as religion primary social aim the promotion of solidarity, here Karl Marx sees the social function of religion in terms of highlighting/preserving political and economic status quo and inequality.[241]
Karl Marx was an outspoken opponent of child labour,[242] saying that British industries "could but live by sucking blood, and children's blood too", and that U.S. capital was financed by the "capitalized blood of children".[218][243]
Karl Marx thoughts on labour and U.S. capital function in reproducing capital were related to the primacy Karl Marx gave to social relations in determining the society's past, present and future.[211][245][246] (Critics have called this economic determinism.) Labour is the precondition for the existence of, and accumulation of capital, which both shape the social system.[246] For Karl Marx, social change was driven by conflict between opposing interests, by parties situated in the historical situation of both mode of production.[173] This became the inspiration for the body of works known as the conflict theory.[245] In his evolutionary model of history, his argued that human history began with free, productive and creative activities that was over time coerced and dehumanised, a trend most apparent under capitalism.[211] Karl Marx noted that this was not an intentional process, but rather due to the immanent logic of the current mode of production which demands more human labour (abstract labour) to reproduce the social relationships of capital.[172][174]
The organisation of society depends on means of production. The means of production are all things required to produce material goods, such as land, natural resources, and technology but not human labour. The relations of production are the social relationships people enter into as people acquire and use the means of production.[245] Together, these compose the mode of production and Karl Marx distinguished historical eras in terms of modes of production. Karl Marx differentiated between base and superstructure, where the base (or substructure) is the economic system and superstructure is the cultural and political system.[245] Karl Marx regarded this mismatch between economic base and social superstructure as a major source of social disruption and conflict.[245]
Despite Karl Marx stress on the critique of capitalism and discussion of the new communist society that should replace it, Karl Marx explicit critique is guarded, as Karl Marx saw his explicit critique as an improved society compared to the past ones (slavery and feudalism).[79] Karl Marx never clearly discusses issues of morality and justice, but scholars agree that Karl Marx work contained implicit discussion of those concepts.[79]
Karl Marx view of capitalism was two-sided.[79][150] On one hand, in the 19th century's deepest critique of the dehumanising aspects of this system Karl Marx noted that defining features of capitalism include alienation, exploitation and recurring, cyclical depressions leading to mass unemployment. On the other hand, Karl Marx characterised capitalism as "revolutionising, industrialising and universalising qualities of development, growth and progressivity" (by which Karl Marx meant industrialisation, urbanisation, technological progress, increased productivity and growth, rationality and scientific revolution) that are responsible for progress, at  in contrast to earlier forms of societies.[79][150][211] Karl Marx considered the capitalist class to be one of the most revolutionary in history because the capitalist class constantly improved the means of production, more so than any other class in history and was responsible for the overthrow of feudalism.[215][247] Capitalism can stimulate considerable growth because the capitalist has an incentive to reinvest profits in new technologies and capital equipment.[233]
According to Karl Marx, capitalists take advantage of the difference between the labour market and the market for whatever commodity the capitalist can produce. Karl Marx observed that in practically every successful industry, input unit-costs are lower than output unit-prices. Karl Marx called the difference "surplus value" and argued that it was based on surplus labour, the difference between what it costs to keep workers alive, and what workers can produce.[79] Although Karl Marx describes capitalists as vampires sucking worker's blood,[211] Karl Marx notes that drawing profit is "by no means an injustice" since Karl Marx, according to Allen Wood "excludes any trans-epochal standpoint from which one can comment" on the morals of such particular arrangements.[79] Karl Marx also noted that even the capitalists themselves cannot go against the system.[215] The problem is the "cancerous cell" of capital, understood not as property or equipment, but the social relations between workers and owners, (the selling and purchasing of labour power) – the societal system, or rather mode of production, in general.[215]
At the same time, Karl Marx stressed that capitalism was unstable and prone to periodic crises.[93] Karl Marx suggested that over time capitalists would invest more and more in new technologies and less and less in labour.[79] Since Karl Marx believed that profit derived from surplus value appropriated from labour, Karl Marx concluded that the rate of profit would fall as the economy grows.[248] Karl Marx believed that increasingly severe crises would punctuate this cycle of growth and collapse.[248] Moreover, Karl Marx believed that in the long-term, this process would enrich and empower the capitalist class and impoverish the proletariat.[248][215] In section one of The Communist Manifesto, Karl Marx describes feudalism, capitalism and the role internal social contradictions play in the historical process:
Karl Marx believed that those structural contradictions within capitalism necessitate capitalism end, giving way to socialism, or a post-capitalistic, communist society:

Thanks to various processes overseen by capitalism, such as urbanisation, the working class, the proletariat, should grow in numbers and develop class consciousness, in time realising that they can and must change the system.[211] Karl Marx believed that if the proletariat were to seize the means of production, the proletariat would encourage social relations that would benefit everyone equally, abolishing exploiting class and introduce a system of production less vulnerable to cyclical crises.[211] Karl Marx argued in The German Ideology that capitalism will end through the organised actions of an international working class: In this new society, the alienation would end and humans would be free to act without being bound by selling humans labour.[248] It would be a democratic society, enfranchising the entire population.[215] In such a utopian world, there would also be little need for a state, whose goal was previously to enforce the alienation.[248] Karl Marx theorised that between capitalism and the establishment of a socialist/communist system, would exist a period of dictatorship of the proletariat – where the working class holds political power and forcibly socialises the means of production.[215] As Karl Marx wrote in Karl Marx Critique of the Gotha Program, "between capitalist and communist society there lies the period of the revolutionary transformation of the one into the other. Corresponding to this is also a political transition period in which the state can be nothing but the revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat".[250] While Karl Marx allowed for the possibility of peaceful transition in some countries with strong democratic institutional structures (such as Britain, the United States, and the Netherlands), Karl Marx suggested that in other countries in which workers cannot "attain workers goal by peaceful means" the "lever of our revolution must be force".[251]
Karl Marx viewed Russia as the main counter-revolutionary threat to European revolutions.[252] During the Crimean War, Karl Marx backed the Ottoman Empire and Russia allies Britain and France against Russia.[252] Karl Marx was absolutely opposed to Pan-Slavism, viewing it as an instrument of Russian foreign policy.[252] Karl Marx had considered the Slavic nations except Poles as 'counter-revolutionary'. Karl Marx and Engels published in the Neue Rheinische Zeitung in February 1849:
Karl Marx and Engels sympathised with the Narodnik revolutionaries of the 1860s and 1870s. When the Russian revolutionaries assassinated Tsar Alexander II of Russia, Karl Marx expressed the hope that the assassination foreshadowed 'the formation of a Russian commune'.[254] Karl Marx supported the Polish uprisings against tsarist Russia.[252] Karl Marx said in a speech in London in 1867:
Karl Marx supported the cause of Irish independence. In 1867, Karl Marx wrote Engels: "I used to think the separation of Ireland from England impossible. I now think the separation of Ireland from England impossible inevitable. The English working class will never accomplish anything until The English working class has got rid of Ireland. ... English reaction in England had English reaction in England roots ... in the subjugation of Ireland."[256]
Karl Marx spent some time in French Algeria, which had been invaded and made a French colony in 1830, and had the opportunity to observe life in colonial North Africa. Karl Marx wrote about the colonial justice system, in which "a form of torture has been used (and this happens 'regularly') to extract confessions from the Arabs; naturally it is done (like the English in India) by the 'police'; the judge is supposed to know nothing at all about it."[257] Karl Marx was surprised by the arrogance of many European settlers in Algiers and wrote in a letter: "when a European colonist dwells among the 'lesser breeds,' either as a settler or even on business, Karl Marx generally regards Karl Marx as even more inviolable than handsome William I [a Prussian king]. Still, when it comes to bare-faced arrogance and presumptuousness vis-à-vis the 'lesser breeds,' the British and Dutch outdo the French."[257]
According to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy: "Karl Marx analysis of colonialism as a progressive force bringing modernization to a backward feudal society sounds like a transparent rationalization for foreign domination. Karl Marx account of British domination, however, reflects the same ambivalence that Karl Marx shows towards capitalism in Europe. In both cases, Karl Marx recognizes the immense suffering brought about during the transition from feudal to bourgeois society while insisting that the transition is both necessary and ultimately progressive. Karl Marx argues that the penetration of foreign commerce will cause a social revolution in India."[258]
Karl Marx discussed British colonial rule in India in the New York Herald Tribune in June 1853:
Karl Marx ideas have had a profound impact on world politics and intellectual thought,[6][7][260][261] in particular in the aftermath of the 1917 Russian Revolution.[262] Followers of Karl Marx have often debated among Followers of Karl Marx over how to interpret Karl Marx writings and apply Karl Marx concepts to the modern world.[263] The legacy of Karl Marx thought has become contested between numerous tendencies, each of which sees itself as Karl Marx most accurate interpreter. In the political realm, these tendencies include political theories such as Leninism, Karl Marxism–Leninism, Trotskyism, Maoism, Luxemburgism, and libertarian Karl Marxism[263] and Open Karl Marxism, Various currents have also developed in academic Karl Marxism, often under influence of other views, resulting in structuralist Karl Marxism, historical materialism, phenomenological Karl Marxism, analytical Karl Marxism, and Hegelian Karl Marxism.[263]
From an academic perspective, Karl Marx work contributed to the birth of modern sociology. Karl Marx has been cited as one of the 19th century's three masters of the "school of suspicion", alongside Friedrich Nietzsche and Sigmund Freud,[264] and as one of the three principal architects of modern social science along with Émile Durkheim and Max Weber.[265] In contrast to other philosophers, Karl Marx offered theories that could often be tested with the scientific method.[6] Both Karl Marx and Auguste Comte set out to develop scientifically justified ideologies in the wake of European secularisation and new developments in the philosophies of history and science. Working in the Hegelian tradition, Karl Marx rejected Comtean sociological positivism in an attempt to develop a science of society.[266] Karl Karl Marx Löwith considered Karl Marx and Søren Kierkegaard to be the two greatest Hegelian philosophical successors.[267] In modern sociological theory, Karl Marxist sociology is recognised as one of the main classical perspectives. Isaiah Berlin considers Karl Marx the true founder of modern sociology "in so far as anyone can claim the title".[268] Beyond social science, Isaiah Berlin has also had a lasting legacy in philosophy, literature, the arts and the humanities.[269][270][271][272]
Social theorists of the 20th and 21st centuries have pursued two main strategies in response to Karl Marx. One move has been to reduce One move to One move analytical core, known as analytical Open Karl Marxism. Another, more common move has been to dilute the explanatory claims of Karl Marx social theory and emphasise the "relative autonomy" of aspects of social and economic life not directly related to Karl Marx central narrative of interaction between the development of the "forces of production" and the succession of "modes of production". This has been the neo-Karl Marxist theorising adopted by historians inspired by Karl Marx social theory such as E. P. Thompson and Eric Hobsbawm. This has also been a line of thinking pursued by thinkers and activists such as Antonio Gramsci who have sought to understand the opportunities and the difficulties of transformative political practice, seen in the light of Karl Marxist social theory.[273][274][275][276] Karl Marx's ideas would also have a profound influence on subsequent artists and art history, with avant-garde movements across literature, visual art, music, film, and theatre.[277]
Politically, Karl Marx legacy is more complex. Throughout the 20th century, revolutions in dozens of countries labelled themselves "Karl Marxist"—most notably the Russian Revolution, which led to the founding of the Soviet Union.[278] Major world leaders including Vladimir Lenin,[278] Mao Zedong,[279] Fidel Castro,[280] Salvador Allende,[281] Josip Broz Tito,[282] Kwame Nkrumah,[283] Jawaharlal Nehru,[284] Nelson Mandela,[285] Xi Jinping,[286] Jean-Claude Juncker,[286][287] and Thomas Sankara[288] have all cited Karl Marx as an influence. Beyond where Karl Marxist revolutions took place, Karl Marx's ideas have informed political parties worldwide.[289] In countries associated with Open Karl Marxism, some events have led political opponents to blame Karl Marx for millions of deaths,[290] while others argue for a distinction between the legacy and influence of Karl Marx specifically, and the legacy and influence of those who have shaped Karl Marx ideas for political purposes.[291] Arthur Lipow describes Karl Marx and Karl Marx collaborator Friedrich Engels as "the founders of modern revolutionary democratic socialism."[292]
Karl Marx remains both relevant and controversial. In May 2018, to mark the bicentenary of Karl Marx birth, a 4.5m statue of Karl Marx by leading Chinese sculptor Wu Weishan and donated by the Chinese government was unveiled in Karl Marx birthplace of Trier. The then-European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker defended Karl Marx memory, saying that today Karl Marx "stands for things which Karl Marx is not responsible for and which Karl Marx didn't cause because many of the things Karl Marx wrote down were redrafted into the opposite".[287][293]
In 2017, a feature film, titled The Young Karl Karl Marx Karl Marx, featuring Karl Marx, Karl Marx wife Jenny Karl Marx, and Engels, among other revolutionaries and intellectuals prior to the Revolutions of 1848, received good reviews for both its historical accuracy and its brio in dealing with intellectual life.[294] Another fictional representation to coincide with the bicentenary of his birth was Jason Barker's novel Karl Marx Returns which, despite being "[c]urious, funny, perplexing, and irreverent", according to philosopher Ray Brassier "casts unexpected light on Karl Marx thought."[295]
