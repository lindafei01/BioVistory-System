subject, relation, action, dimension:life, type:temporal, date:the 19th century's, origin:Karl Marx noted that this was not an intentional process, but rather due to the immanent logic of the current mode of production which demands more human labour (abstract labour) to reproduce the social relationships of capital.[172][174]

subject, relation, action, dimension:life, type:temporal, date:February 1849, origin:In section one of The Communist Manifesto, Karl Marx describes feudalism, capitalism and the role internal social contradictions play in the historical process:
Karl Marx believed that those structural contradictions within capitalism necessitate its end, giving way to socialism, or a post-capitalistic, communist society:

Thanks to various processes overseen by capitalism, such as urbanisation, the working class, the proletariat, should grow in numbers and develop class consciousness, in time realising that they can and must change the system.[211] Karl Marx believed that if the proletariat were to seize the means of production, they would encourage social relations that would benefit everyone equally, abolishing exploiting class and introduce a system of production less vulnerable to cyclical crises.[211] Karl Marx argued in The German Ideology that capitalism will end through the organised actions of an international working class: In this new society, the alienation would end and humans would be free to act without being bound by selling their labour.[248] It would be a democratic society, enfranchising the entire population.[215]
subject, relation, action, dimension:life, type:temporal, date:1860s, origin:In such a utopian world, there would also be little need for a state, whose goal was previously to enforce the alienation.[248]

subject, relation, action, dimension:life, type:temporal, date:1917, origin:Karl Marx was surprised by the arrogance of many European settlers in Algiers and wrote in a letter: "when a European colonist dwells among the 'lesser breeds,' either as a settler or even on business, he generally regards himself as even more inviolable than handsome William I
