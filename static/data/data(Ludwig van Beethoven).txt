subject, relation, action, dimension:life, type:temporal, date:1801–1802, origin:It has been suggested that Ludwig van Beethoven largely abandoned composition between 1785 and 1790, possibly as a result of negative critical reaction to his first published works.
subject, relation, action, dimension:life, type:geography, date:1785, origin:The three early piano quartets of 1785 (WoO 36), closely modelled on violin sonatas of Mozart, show his dependency on the music of the period.
subject, relation, action, dimension:life, type:temporal, date:between 1785 and 1790, origin:Ludwig van Beethoven himself was not to give any of the Bonn works an opus number, save for those which he reworked for use later in his career, for example, some of the songs in his Op.

subject, relation, action, dimension:life, type:temporal, date:1792, origin:His works from 1795 to 1800 are larger in scale than was the norm (writing sonatas in four movements, not three, for instance); typically he uses a scherzo rather than a minuet and trio; and his music often includes dramatic, even sometimes over-the-top, uses of extreme dynamics and tempi and chromatic harmony.
subject, relation, action, dimension:life, type:temporal, date:1792, origin:He also explored new directions and gradually expanded the scope and ambition of his work.
subject, relation, action, dimension:life, type:temporal, date:the first few years, origin:Some important pieces from the early period are the first and second symphonies, the set of six string quartets Opus 18, the first two piano concertos, and the first dozen or so piano sonatas, including the famous Pathétique sonata, Op. 13.

subject, relation, action, dimension:life, type:temporal, date:1795, origin:Middle-period works include six symphonies (Nos. 3–8), the last two piano concertos, the Triple Concerto and violin concerto, five string quartets (Nos. 7–11), several piano sonatas (including the Waldstein and Appassionata sonatas), the Kreutzer violin sonata and his only opera, Fidelio.

subject, relation, action, dimension:life, type:relation, date:almost a decade, origin:The Érard piano, with its exceptional resonance, may have influenced Ludwig van Beethoven's piano style – shortly after receiving it he began writing his Waldstein Sonata[206] – but despite initial enthusiasm he seems to have abandoned it before 1810, when he wrote that it was "simply not of any use any more"; in 1824 he gave it to his brother Johann.[206][n 15]
