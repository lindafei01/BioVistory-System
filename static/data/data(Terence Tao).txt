subject, relation, action, dimension:life, type:temporal, date:From 2001 to 2010, origin:In many cases these results were sharp enough to perfectly complement well-posedness results for sufficiently large exponents as due to Bourgain, Colliander−Keel−Staffilani−Takaoka−Terence Tao, and others.

subject, relation, action, dimension:life, type:relation, date:2016, origin:Terence Tao speculated that the Navier–Stokes equations might be able to simulate a Turing complete system, and that as a consequence it might be possible to (negatively) resolve the existence and smoothness problem using a modification of his results.[6][24]
subject, relation, action, dimension:life, type:geography, date:2001, origin:Here one studies the operation which restricts input functions on Euclidean space to a submanifold and outputs the product of the Fourier transforms of the corresponding measures.
subject, relation, action, dimension:life, type:temporal, date:1970s.[57][58][59, origin:Such multilinear problems originated in the 1990s, including in notable work of Jean Bourgain, Sergiu Klainerman, and Matei Machedon.[60][61][62]
subject, relation, action, dimension:life, type:relation, date:2003, origin:In mathematical terms, most of their results identify settings in which a convex optimisation problem correctly computes the solution of an optimisation problem which seems to lack a computationally tractable structure.
subject, relation, action, dimension:life, type:relation, date:multilinear, origin:These problems are of the nature of finding the solution of an underdetermined linear system with the minimal possible number of nonzero entries, referred to as "sparsity".

subject, relation, action, dimension:life, type:temporal, date:2011, origin:If one considers two such random matrices which agree on the average value of any quadratic polynomial in the diagonal entries and on the average value of any quartic polynomial in the off-diagonal entries, then Terence Tao and Vu show that the expected value of a large number of functions of the eigenvalues will also coincide, up to an error which is uniformly controllable by the size of the matrix and which becomes arbitrarily small as the size of the matrix increases.[TV11] Similar results were obtained around the same time by László Erdös, Horng-Tzer Yau, and Jun Yin.[78][79]
In 2004, Terence Tao, together with Jean Bourgain and Nets Katz, studied the additive and multiplicative structure of subsets of finite fields of prime order.[BKT04]

subject, relation, action, dimension:life, type:temporal, date:1975, origin:The Green–Terence Tao theorem then arises as a special case, although it is not trivial to show that the prime numbers satisfy the conditions of Green and Terence Tao's extension of the Szemerédi theorem.

subject, relation, action, dimension:life, type:temporal, date:2010, origin:The proof of Green and Terence Tao was incomplete, as it was conditioned upon unproven conjectures.
